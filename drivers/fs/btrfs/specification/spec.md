# btrfs — Specification

## 1. Purpose & scope

The existing btrfs volume, subvolume and multi-device implementation. The driver README documents supported profiles and mutation operations.

## 2. Assumptions

Block devices are supplied by `narf-block`; the VFS owns mount attachment
and namespace policy.

## 3. Public interface

`register_fstypes()` registers `btrfs` in the shared named-mount registry.
It performs no device I/O. The constructor resolves a registered block source,
validates options and returns an unattached `Arc<dyn FsInstance>`.
Both legacy mount and fsconfig use this constructor. Existing volume/node APIs
are described in the [driver README](../README.md) and their Rust documentation.

## 4. Invariants

Filesystem constructors execute without the registry lock held. Missing
sources return `FsError::NotFound`; failed construction publishes no mount.
Device ownership remains pinned by the returned filesystem instance.

## 5. Architecture notes

The registration interface is shared by x86_64 and aarch64. Volume construction
uses the existing async block I/O implementation through the scheduler bridge.

## 6. Dependencies

`narf-filesystem`, `narf-block`, `narf-scheduler` and the driver runtime.

## 7. Stage assignment

Stage 4: persistent filesystem compatibility.

## 8. Open questions

The named mount path retains the implementation's existing format and option
limits; registration does not add support for further on-disk features.
