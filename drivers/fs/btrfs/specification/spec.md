# btrfs — Specification

## 1. Purpose & scope

The existing btrfs volume, subvolume and multi-device implementation. The driver README documents supported profiles and mutation operations.

## 2. Assumptions

Block devices are supplied by `narf-block`; the VFS owns mount attachment
and namespace policy.

## 3. Public interface

`register_fstypes()` registers `btrfs` in the shared named-mount registry.
It performs no device I/O. The constructor resolves a registered block source,
validates options and returns an unattached `Arc<dyn FsInstance>`.
Both legacy mount and fsconfig use this constructor. Existing volume/node APIs
are described in the [driver README](../README.md) and their Rust documentation.

Write safety (`rw_gate`):

```rust
pub mod rw_gate {
    pub const WRITER_INCOMPAT: u64;      // = format::SUPPORTED_INCOMPAT_FLAGS
    pub const WRITER_COMPAT_RO: u64;     // = format::WRITE_SUPPORTED_COMPAT_RO_FLAGS
    pub const ROOT_RW_INCOMPAT: u64;     // narrow production-root set
    pub enum Profile { Default, RootRw } // RootRw under narf.disks=root-rw
    pub enum Refusal { Incompat(u64), CompatRo(u64), FreeSpaceTreeInvalid,
        NoFreeSpaceTree, LogTree(u64), ChecksumType(u16), SectorSize(u32),
        NodeSize(u32), ErrorState, SuperFlags(u64), Generation, MultiDevice(u64),
        BalanceInProgress, ReplaceInProgress, RelocationInProgress, AnotherWriter }
    pub fn active_profile() -> Profile;
    pub fn check_superblock(sb: &Superblock, super_flags: u64, p: Profile) -> Result<(), Refusal>;
    pub async fn check_trees(vol: &BtrfsVolume<B>) -> Result<(), Refusal>;
    pub fn claim_writer(fsid: [u8; 16], p: Profile) -> Result<WriterClaim, Refusal>;
    pub fn supported_features(p: Profile) -> (Vec<&str>, Vec<&str>);
    pub fn last_refusal() -> Option<String>;
}
BtrfsVolume::mount_devices_claimed(devices, domain, read_only)  // VFS-visible mounts
FsInstance::always_read_only() for BtrfsVolume == is_read_only()
pub mod interop { pub fn run(mode: &str) -> InitResult }        // test vehicle
```

## 4. Invariants

Filesystem constructors execute without the registry lock held. Missing
sources return `FsError::NotFound`; failed construction publishes no mount.
Device ownership remains pinned by the returned filesystem instance.

A volume about to be mounted read-write runs `rw_gate` after the chunk map is
loaded and before anything can write (log replay, the commit timer, any VFS
operation); a refusal makes it read-only for its lifetime and is logged. At
most one VFS-visible writable volume exists per fsid (`claim_writer`); a
read-write `mount -t btrfs` that cannot be honoured returns
`FsError::ReadOnly` (EROFS). Data extents are allocated only from DATA block
groups and tree blocks only from METADATA ones. A write through an open file
uses the inode item from the tree, never the node's cached copy.

## 5. Architecture notes

The registration interface is shared by x86_64 and aarch64. Volume construction
uses the existing async block I/O implementation through the scheduler bridge.

## 6. Dependencies

`narf-filesystem`, `narf-block`, `narf-scheduler` and the driver runtime.

## 7. Stage assignment

Stage 4: persistent filesystem compatibility.

## 8. Open questions

The named mount path retains the implementation's existing format and option
limits; registration does not add support for further on-disk features.
