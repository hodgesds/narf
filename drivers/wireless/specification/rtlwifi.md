# rtlwifi — Specification

> Status: PCI/EFUSE identity, retained RTL8188EE paged firmware and inactive native rings;
> native packet/RF/station software remains incomplete.

## 1. Purpose & scope

Owns diagnostic detection of RTL8188EE, RTL8192CE/DE/EE, RTL8723AE/BE,
and RTL8821AE. RTL8822BE belongs to rtw88 and is no longer matched here.

## 2. Assumptions

The caller owns the PCI function exclusively. Linux's per-chip `bar_id=2`
selects the register aperture. Diagnostic probe does not initialize packet
DMA, unmask device IRQs or report association success.

## 3. Public interface

`pci::bring_up(device, cap)` first parks inherited PCI DMA through the shared
Realtek command policy: clear `BUS_MASTER`, enable `MEM_SPACE | INTX_DISABLE`,
and read back the command register. Any access failure, retained BME or missing
requested decoding fails before BAR mapping. Bus mastering remains disabled
on success and every later error; identity and ring allocation do not authorize
DMA. A repeat probe of the retained bus address returns without configuration access; a distinct additional singleton match parks only its own PCI function. Re-enabling
BME requires a future complete firmware/ring/reset owner.

`RtlwifiDevice::registers` is the mandatory BAR2 `map_bar_control` mapping;
it must cover through EFUSE access gate `0xcf`. Probe enables MEM decoding,
runs the profile power flow and reads factory identity with IRQs masked.
The mapping and actual power/IRQ/EFUSE operations execute inside the current
PCI `Cap::invoke` operation. The same invocation helper protects every native
firmware access; holding a retained token alone grants no register access.
MAC/LLT code is not dispatched as if a packet DMA owner already existed.

`efuse::read_mac(registers, pci_device_id, pci_function)` reads sparse physical
programming records and returns a nonzero unicast identity. The helper sets
read clocks, uses the appropriate access/power gate, triggers reads by clearing
bit 31, waits for it to set, allows data to settle and closes access on failure.
Programming LDOE25 is not enabled for a read.

| Profile | Unprotected physical bytes | Logical bytes | MAC offset |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 8188EE / 8192EE / 8723BE / 8821AE | 238 | 512 | `0xd0` |
| 8192CE and alternate ID | 497 | 128 | `0x16` |
| 8192DE function 0 / 1 | 497 | 256 | `0x55` / `0x5b` |
| 8723AE | 497 | 256 | `0x67` |

Unknown geometry/functions fail before I/O. Sparse-map bounds/overrides
share the checked Realtek record decoder. Scan, association and configuration
continue to return `NotSupported`; packet TX remains unavailable.

`power::run_with(io, cut, fab, interface, table)` is the production-shared
byte-register parser: selected rows preserve unrelated fields, PCI rows use
MAC base, register failures stop at the exact transaction, and unknown commands,
invalid delay units or missing END fail. `power_on_with` selects the flow.
RTL8188EE uses the complete Linux PCI NIC-enable flow, including
CardDisabled→CardEmu, BB reset, Schmitt trigger and LDO-normal. It first performs
the Linux XCK-output/HWPDN/reserved-register-unlock prefix. Other parts still
require their complete reset/power qualification.

RTL8188EE probe retains `firmware_transport::Owner<firmware_native::PciIo>`
before spawning `initialize_registered()`. `RtlwifiDevice::firmware_status()`
returns the shared attempt state; other profiles return None. Registry selection
uses exactly `rtlwifi/rtl8188eefw.bin`, authenticated through firmware authority.
The complete 32-byte header, exact nonempty declared RAM-code length, 88E1
signature and at most eight 4096-byte pages are checked before allocation/I/O.
The EE filename remains mandatory because the signature alone cannot distinguish
USB EU firmware. Supplied-byte `initialize` is for authenticated owners/tests.

The one-shot owner closes CR HCI/TX/RX DMA and MAC packet gates and verifies
readback, enables the CPU clock, performs 8051 reset when replacing a running
image, writes selected 4KiB pages at MMIO0x1000 in bounded byte chunks, pads the
final dword and awaits fresh checksum plus firmware WINTINI readiness. It checks
reserved page-selector/CPU bits and stops on absent device, stale authority,
active BME or a short BAR. Every real MMIO operation occurs inside Cap::invoke
and validates MEM decoding with BME disabled. No raw authority/handle escapes.

States are Detected, Validated, Preparing, Downloading, Ready and terminal
Failed(error). The bounded attempt is self-driven/async, holds no IRQ-disabling
guard across await, and never invokes block_on in a spawned task. Cancellation,
timeout or write/checksum/start failure prevents retry and performs no cleanup
I/O. Ready means a running firmware CPU, with packet DMA/IRQ/station admission
still closed. The one-shot native continuation below does not dispatch
H2C/C2H or advertise HT/VHT support. The diagnostic interface remains down.

`prepare::Prepared<I, M>` is the RTL8188EE-only inactive descriptor/LLT owner.
It validates DMA32 full extents, alignment and overlap before MMIO, constructs
seven distinct linked 64-byte TX rings (DW10 next pointers, all OWN clear),
one 32-byte RX ring and separately retained 4096-byte RX buffers (DW6 address,
OWN/EOR). Exact Linux `_rtl88ee_llt_table_init` uses boundary0xab/max-page0xaf;
all seven queue bases and RX base use the 8188EE register map. No 8192EE TXBD
count registers or aliased queue bases are used. BME stays off, PCIe DMA byte
0x301 stays0xff, CR packet gates and both interrupt masks remain closed.

The private `prepare_native` adapter claims one non-cloneable `PacketIo` from
the exact successful firmware owner. Failed allocation, cancellation and Drop
never reopen that claim. Every actual allocation/register access uses current
PCI authority and verifies parked bus mastering; unsupported per-domain IOMMU
mode is rejected. The controller and diagnostic interface share an async
mutex that retains the complete native owner before its first base write.
`RtlwifiDevice::native_preparation_status()` reports its Allocated/Prepared/
terminal Failed state; None covers unallocated state (including allocation
failure) or initialization holding the async guard. Cancellation installs Failed before awaiting LLT. Published mappings
are retained on every error/Drop until a future reset/quiescence proof; no
firmware/reset helper may reconstruct a second packet owner.

`initialize_registered` now composes authenticated firmware boot with that
retained inactive preparation in the real probe worker. Ready firmware plus
Prepared rings remains below RF/BB/calibration and active packet admission.

## 4. Invariants

Read requests never set the programming trigger. Preserve unrelated EFUSE
address/control and SYS-clock bits. Exclude protected physical tails, reject
truncated/outside records, and never register an invalid factory identity.

## 5. Architecture notes

BAR mapping and byte-order conversion are architecture independent. Shared
register-model smokes cover every matched geometry and both dual-MAC functions.

## 6. Dependencies

Bus/PCI ownership, MMIO and firmware registry follow their subsystem contracts.
The scheduler's responsive wait supplies bounded EFUSE completion/settling.

## 7. Stage assignment

Factory identity, RTL8188EE CPU firmware and inactive LLT/linked-ring
preparation are software covered.
Complete station software and physical
board qualification remain required.
