# rtw89 — Specification

> Status: AX factory identity, checked firmware preparation, native cold-power
> primitives, composed cold discovery/CH12/WCPU startup and bounded native TX
> ownership are implemented. Packet/RF/station startup remains incomplete.

## 1. Purpose & scope

Owns RTL8852A/B/C, RTL8851B and planned RTL8922A PCIe support. Current live
identity code implements AX DDV EFUSE; BE has a different read/block layout.

## 2. Assumptions

The diagnostic caller owns BAR2, mapped with Device attributes and covering the
register window. The private cold claim instead parks PCI DMA, maps BAR2 and
reads the actual chip cut itself. The diagnostic probe still uses its existing
power prologue; the composed cold/WCPU path does not replace it until packet,
RF and complete startup prerequisites are implemented. No factory-MAC result establishes station readiness.

## 3. Public interface

`pci::bring_up(device, cap)` first parks inherited PCI DMA through the shared
Realtek command policy: clear `BUS_MASTER`, enable `MEM_SPACE | INTX_DISABLE`,
and read back the command register. Any access failure, retained BME or missing
requested decoding fails before BAR mapping. Bus mastering remains disabled
on success and every later error; identity and ring allocation do not authorize
DMA. A repeat probe of the retained bus address returns without configuration access; a distinct additional singleton match parks only its own PCI function. Re-enabling
BME requires the composed owned cold/firmware-download path or a future
complete packet/ring/reset owner.
The complete diagnostic mapping/power/identity operation runs within actual
capability invocation. It retains unpublished storage, with no ring base/index
publication, enabled MSI-X delivery, RX pump or network-interface registration.
The private native TX/report hooks also invoke the retained device capability;
revocation returns `Authority` before register access or packet allocation.

The internal `prepared::load(Files, ChipId, physical_cut)` selects owned
verified firmware snapshots. AX filenames use the Linux `rtw89/rtw8852*_fw`
and `rtw8851b_fw` basenames, preferring supported format suffixes before the
unversioned fallback. Only a missing file permits filename fallback; invalid
images or missing/revoked authority abort. 8852B/8851B prefer the NORMAL_CE
image, then NORMAL. MFW selection bounds every entry before choosing the
nearest non-manufacturing cut at or below the physical revision. BE is rejected
before file access. The native registry adapter copies bytes inside the actual
firmware capability invocation.

`fwdl::parse_auto` accepts AX header versions0/1 only: base sizes32/48 and
section size16 in both versions. Inner section types remain four bits; BBMCU
is an outer image type. AX download chunks are2020 bytes independent of header
version. Header/table/dynamic-extension/payload extents and indexed/formatted
MSSC signature pools, including v1 DSP checksums, are checked before committing
caller section output. A malformed image leaves that output untouched.
`PreparedFirmware` keeps selected-image, payload and signature-pool offsets
bound to one immutable owner and physical chip profile. The private
`DownloadPlan` combines that owner with successfully read physical secure
fuses. Unknown programmed fuses fail explicitly; erased selection is accepted
only after both actual DDV bytes are read. Indexed and formatted signatures
use the Linux AX selection/stride rules, checked bitmap dimensions/rank and
pool extents. Secure hardware requires a matching signature and a host
blacklist at least as new as the image's version; B/C have the upstream
version0 empty policy, while A/51 require an authenticated board policy.
No missing policy or signature falls back to an unsecured transfer.

The plan couples v1 ignored-security descriptor compaction/count with the
same payload selection, strips host dynamic bytes and sets part_size2020.
B's secure v0 length960 override changes both descriptor and payload; ambiguous
checksum-bearing overrides and v0 ignored-descriptor cases fail explicitly.
Signatures replace bytes only in owned output, preserving the verified image.
Header H2C requests no runtime ACK; section chunks are raw firmware bytes
without an invented H2C/last flag. The plan alone performs no hardware I/O.

The private `command_native::Native` CH12 backend owns checked coherent packet
and ring allocations. Constructor/configuration require independently fenced
DMA and verified PCI BME-off. `enable_download` requires the actual completed
cold/factory/basic/PCIe/BDRAM/DLE/HFC owners and an empty CH12 ring; it enables
only CH12 TX DMA, verifies both independent RX layers remain disabled, then
sets and reads back PCI BME as the final publication. WPDMA and all packet
channels remain stopped. The backend rejects the incomplete per-domain IOMMU
path.
All register operations invoke current device authority and check complete
width/alignment extents. Real revocation rejects the constructor before
unmapped configuration access and prevents later packet publication.

The retained `bdram::Bdram` owner implements the internal AX preparation subset
for 8852A/B/C/8851B. With independently fenced old DMA and BME off, it stops
WPDMA and global host DMA, applies the exact per-profile TX/RX idle checks
(10-us interval, 100-us budget), clears supported indices, writes/readbacks
Linux's dual/single internal BDRAM partitions and C's 16-entry WP selector,
then waits for the self-clearing BDRAM reset (1-us interval, 100-us budget).
All supported hardware TX/RX indices must actually read zero. It leaves global
and channel DMA stopped and verifies those bits; no ring base/count, interrupt
or bus-master activation is part of preparation. Failure or dropped waits leave
Preparing and reject reuse before I/O; a replacement requires an independently
verified reset. BE is rejected before any register access.
`Native::prepare_bdram(ber)` invokes current PCI authority to verify BME-off/MEM
decoding, retains PCI basic configuration, then composes DLFW DLE/HFC,
exact AX PCIe MAC-pre-init policy and
BDRAM/index preparation through capability-scoped accesses. Mode programming
occurs after DMA idle and index clear, before partition/reset. `Native::configure`
requires that same retained owner's basic/PCIe, FIFO and BDRAM Ready receipts before
system-memory ring publication. The diagnostic probe still does not call it.
Linux-C traces cover the four AX profiles and nonzero inherited register fields;
negative models cover every access failure, ignored writes, dirty indices,
device disappearance, both wait deadlines, cancellation and actual revocation.
This closes internal partition/index and PCIe MAC-pre-init preparation only:
full post-firmware MAC/RF startup, RX and IRQ ownership remain required, and Ready is neither a DMA-reclamation nor station proof.

Firmware commands have a24-byte TXWD body on A/B/51 and a16-byte RX-like
descriptor on C. TXBD length includes descriptor plus command bytes; there
is no WP/address-info extension. Hardware RP is bits27:16 and host WP bits11:0;
host doorbells write only the low16-bit half. `CommandQueue` retains mappings
before descriptor/doorbell publication, validates whole read-pointer movement
before retirement, and preserves the last eight consumed commands for the
Linux multi-tag delay. Failed publication and Drop retain queued/quarantined
DMA and the published ring. Only an independent hardware stop/idle/prefetch
fence permits explicit reclamation; capability revocation or BME-off alone
does not establish that proof. The private cold/download composition activates
this backend, while the diagnostic probe keeps it inactive until complete
post-firmware MAC/RF and packet/station startup is implemented.

The private `firmware_boot::Firmware<Transport>` retains the plan and prepared
CH12 transport through one WCPU reset/download attempt. It checks chip identity
and fresh, never-published transport preparation before starting; an empty ring
that has already carried a command cannot authorize another WCPU reset.
AX watchdog/platform reset and CPU
enable precede secure IDMEM mode recording, H2C-path readiness, the sequence0
header command, FWDL-path readiness and ordered raw sections. A five-ms settle
and bounded firmware-control status7 check precede `Running`; status6 alone
does not authorize runtime commands. A/C watchdog accesses require the full
indirect BAR aperture at0x40000, checked by the native register backend.
Errors and cancellation retain a non-reusable owner and uncertain command DMA;
retry requires a separate complete fenced reset. Linux C trace comparisons cover
all four AX profiles with zero/nonzero initial registers and secure mode, while
models cover exact prepared transfers, every register-access failure, failed
publication, path/final-status timeout and cancellation. This prerequisite does
not enable the diagnostic probe's DMA or publish a network interface.

`power::Power<Io>::power_on` ports the complete PCI RTL8852A byte table and
RTL8852B/C/8851B power-on callbacks, including XTAL commands, cut/RFE/SPS
quirks, power/ONMAC deadlines, platform edges, isolation and function enables.
`power_off` ports the A off table and B/C/51 callbacks, preserving corrected
physical-cut and calibration identity. It requires independently stopped/fenced
DMA, verified PCI BME-off and serialized producers; it does not grant a DMA
reclamation proof. Callback completion plus explicit MAC-OFF readback permits
the same profile to power on again. `normalize_inherited` applies that off/on
sequence to an inherited ON MAC; unknown transitional states fail explicitly.
Failure/cancellation leaves Starting or Stopping and rejects replay before
further I/O. The native backend checks live capability, extent
and width alignment for every register operation, and provides asynchronous
DDV reads for ECV/secure/factory bytes. Cancelled or incompletely restored DDV
power-cut state stays retained and refuses reuse. These primitives do not yet
activate CH12, publish a station or establish complete MAC/RF readiness.

`fifo::Fifo::prepare` implements the AX firmware-download DLE/HFC pre-init:
per-chip MAC/DMAC and internal AXI enables, WDE64/PLE128 geometry, DLFW quotas
with the SCC WCPU minimum, bounded WDE/PLE readiness, and CH12-only host flow
control. 8852C uses its V1 HFC register page. Independent Linux C traces cover
all four AX profiles with inherited zero and nonzero register seeds. The
operation requires a powered, serialized, DMA-fenced device with PCI BME off;
it publishes no system-memory rings. Failure or cancellation retains
Configuring and refuses replay. The native CH12 preparation now retains this receipt with AX PCIe pre-init
and BDRAM/mode setup. The private cold/download owner now composes these with
factory-qualified power/basic_cfg and WCPU activation; it grants no packet or
station admission.

The private `phy_access::Access` and its `NativeIo` adapter serialize AX PCIe
PHY transactions: A/B/51 MDIO uses the exact Gen1/Gen2 page and five-bit
register selection, while C uses aligned direct RAC words. Explicit DBI byte
fallback is supported only on A/B/51; the future PCI configuration owner must
choose it after a failed primary configuration transaction. Idle checks reject
unknown controller requests before data/address publication. Bounded async
completion, capability-checked widths/extents, and a retained terminal state
prevent failure or cancellation from reopening the same owner. Replacement
requires an independently verified reset. Extracted Linux C traces cover
MDIO read/write/masked writes and DBI byte enables; actual-capability RAM
fixtures check native RAC offsets and revoked access before dereference.
These access prerequisites now support exact AX MAC-pre-init PHY/quirk policy
and PCI basic configuration within the private cold/download composition.
Post-firmware MAC/RF startup and packet/station ownership remain open.

The retained `pcie::Pcie` ports Linux AX MAC-pre-init PHY/power quirks,
per-chip recovery/watchdog/debug settings and the exact truncated-BD,
packet-RX, eight-tag burst/interval modes for 8852A/B/C/8851B. B/51 use the
actual Gen1/Gen2 link-rate configuration byte and disable autorefclk calibration,
matching every retained Linux profile's disabled-autok policy; unknown rates
fail. Temporary L1 configuration is restored on returned PHY failures;
cancellation retains a terminal owner and requires reset. C cut-A and qualified
PCI_BER platform quirks are explicit, with no guessed platform match. Mode
readback rejects ignored programming. The native adapter accesses ECAM bytes
inside actual current capability invocation (avoiding adjacent RW1C fields),
and chooses the serialized DBI fallback only after a failed primary mapping
transaction. PHY protocols retain their existing bounded async ownership.
Independent extracted Linux-C traces cover all four AX profiles, both cuts,
Gen1/Gen2, zero/nonzero inherited fields, L1 enable/restore and C's BER quirk;
negative models cover every access failure, each cancellable transaction edge,
unsupported profiles/rates, ignored mode writes, disappearance and native
revocation. This is PCIe MAC-pre-init policy, not PCI `basic_cfg` equalization,
ASPM/L1SS, RF calibration, full MAC initialization or station readiness.

`pci_basic::Basic` ports AX PCI basic_cfg independently of MAC-pre-init:
C equalization/OOBS/offset and Gen2 gray-code filter calibration, completion
timeout control and Realtek's internal CLKREQ/ASPM/L1SS modules follow actual
host PCI capability enables. Standard/extended capability discovery is bounded,
checks alignment/extents/cycles and refuses unavailable PCIe v2 controls.
Native config words/dwords use naturally aligned, current-capability ECAM
access; byte writes retain the explicit AX DBI fallback. A temporary C ASPM
backup is restored on returned calibration failures; cancellation retains a
non-reusable owner. Forty independent original-Linux-C cases cover all AX
profiles, both link speeds, inherited zero/nonzero fields, calibrated versus
uncalibrated C and host PM enabled/disabled. Fault/cancellation at every access,
malformed capability lists and ignored control writes keep preparation closed.

`factory::Factory` commits a complete actual DDV snapshot only after the
1216-byte physical map, autoload-valid bit and physical0x5e9..0x5ed controls
have been read successfully. It decodes factory MAC, logical RFE/XTAL/country,
B's real power-k marker and secure fuse selection; independently compiled
original Linux packed types establish all four AX field offsets. ECV must
agree with the corrected 8851B cut. No I/O error becomes erased fuse/calibration
defaults. Unknown/failed/cancelled snapshots expose no identity and reject reuse.

`cold::Cold` retains one backend through actual normalized discovery power,
factory reading, confirmed MAC-OFF, factory-only calibration qualification,
PCI basic configuration and calibrated second power-on. Only that completed
owner can transfer its backend and factory/basic receipts into native CH12
ownership. `startup::Startup::claim` actually parks the function, maps BAR2 and
reads its physical cut; A/C require the full watchdog aperture. `start` loads
firmware after ECV correction, builds the fuse-bound download plan and composes
owned FIFO/PCIe/BDRAM/mode/CH12 setup and WCPU initialization. It does not build
a powered receipt from caller booleans or replace the retained PHY/DDV state.
Returned failures and a dropped attempt run best-effort command-DMA/BME closure;
published rings, command packets and uncertain multi-tag references remain
retained. Revocation is checked before unmapped native claim access; the actual
native cancellation fixture retains a published descriptor ring and packet.
The shared TX-only activation models use independent original Linux profile
constants and check that no intermediate write enables either RX layer.
Composed power/factory tests exercise every access failure and cancellable edge,
including inherited ON state, RFE5 and corrected ECV.

This cold/WCPU path still requires an independently established old-DMA fence
and exclusive function claim: BME-off, MAC-OFF and these retained receipts do
not establish reclamation. It is private and does not run in the diagnostic
probe, enable MSI/IRQ delivery, publish RX rings or register a network interface.
A/51 programmed secure boot still needs authenticated board blacklist-policy
loading; B/C retain Linux's version0 policy. Full MAC sys/TRX initialization,
RF/BB tables/calibration, channel/power policy and station/IP composition remain
separate software prerequisites before physical Wi-Fi acceptance.

`efuse::read_mac(registers, ChipId, cut)` runs the AX DDV read lifecycle and
decodes the two-byte sparse records. All four AX profiles use a 1216-byte
physical map with four-byte security prefixes/tails. Logical size is 1536 on
8852A and 2048 on the other AX profiles; PCI MAC is at logical `0x400`.
Offsets were independently checked with C `offsetof` using Linux's structs.

8852A selects/verifies Wi-Fi bank zero. Other AX profiles configure DDV power
cut and undo it after success or timeout; 8852B cut A additionally enables and
clears burst mode. Invalid maps/identities fail explicitly. RTL8922A is
rejected before applying the incompatible AX EFUSE/power sequence.

`tx_transport::prepare_header(chip, info, sequence, frame_dma, frame)` prepares
AX PCI body/WP/address-info records for an initial unprotected, non-QoS,
three-address native profile. It rejects unsupported BE, wrong QSEL/channel,
fragmentation, optional headers, and address extents outside the 40-bit baseline
or 36-bit 8852C address format. Baseline uses a 24-byte body and eight-byte
address info; 8852C uses a 32-byte body and six-byte segments of at most 2044
bytes. TXBD length covers only the descriptor header, never the native payload.
The body-only legacy `datapath::stage_tx` codec is not a PCI submission.

`TxQueue<T>` owns at most the configured ring depth (2..512), reserves a slot,
retains before publication, and transfers ownership only after both TXBD
consumption and an identity-matched AX RPQ release. Stale/contradictory records
and invalid read-pointer movement are explicit errors. Unpublished reservations
can be aborted. Drop cannot prove device quiescence and conservatively retains
outstanding published resources; reset/removal reclamation remains required.

The retained device backend `submit_native` and `complete_native_report` are
private unsafe integration points with an explicit initialized/live-ring and
no-reset contract. They allocate masked DMA, retain header plus payload, perform
cache maintenance and order publication before the doorbell. They have no
station/firmware producer or RPQ pump caller yet. The registered Ethernet
`pci::send_frame` rejects before allocation or MMIO until those owners and
Ethernet-to-native encapsulation exist.

## 4. Invariants

Physical reads write the address and wait for the hardware ready flag before
consuming data. Bounds exclude security control bytes. Missing logical words
remain erased and later records override earlier words. Failures cannot leak
EFUSE power-cut/write-mask/burst settings. TXBD consumption alone cannot free
a packet still referenced by firmware. A report alone cannot recycle a BD still
referenced by DMA. Ring wrap cannot overwrite either retained allocation.

## 5. Architecture notes

EFUSE/register-model tests run on both architecture builds. PCIe DMA/address
width, device ordering and completion lifetime require independent qualification.

## 6. Dependencies

`narf-bus` provides Device BAR mappings, scheduler/time provide responsive
bounded waits, and the firmware registry will supply authenticated images.

## 7. Stage assignment

AX identity is software covered. Existing packet descriptor/ring code is
bring-up scaffolding and does not establish a working station runtime.
