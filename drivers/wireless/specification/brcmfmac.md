# Broadcom FullMAC PCIe — software bring-up

> Status: v0.6. BCM43602 CR4 firmware, retained PCIe control/flow/data
> rings and a constrained FullMAC station path are implemented. Recovery remains
> software work; physical validation is pending.

## 1. Purpose & scope

Owns Broadcom PCIe FullMAC (`brcmfmac`) device ownership, chip discovery,
firmware bootstrap, shared-memory/msgbuf transport, and station integration.
SDIO CYW43439 uses the separate [CYW43439 contract](cyw43439.md).

## 2. Assumptions

PCI matching identifies a candidate, not a validated chip or usable radio.
AI/AMBA ChipCommon is at 0x18000000. The PCIe BAR0 window selects a
4-KiB backplane page through PCI configuration offset 0x80. CPU, RAM,
firmware, and board-data decisions must use discovered chip/revision
information rather than equating the PCI device ID with the chip ID.

## 3. Public interface

`pcie::probe(BusDevice, Cap<BusDeviceCap, Write>)` retains exclusive PCI
authority in a parked controller. `unsafe pcie::bring_up(device, cap)`
requires exclusive BAR/config ownership and returns that same owned state.
Both paths clear inherited `BUS_MASTER|MEM_SPACE`, set `INTX_DISABLE`,
verify all three bits before BAR sizing, then enable and verify memory decode
with bus mastering off. Repeated owned-BDF probes return before PCI access;
extra devices are parked with decode and bus mastering disabled.
The control BAR mapping ignores a firmware-provided prefetchable attribute.
They publish a bound-driver inventory entry before the separate station lifecycle.

`chip::Backplane` supplies serialized fallible `read32`/`write32` operations.
The production PCIe implementation keeps the BAR and capability private;
each access validates alignment/range, selects the page, and verifies
readback with at most one retry. The complete select/access pair runs inside a `CapOp` invocation; the
configuration helpers also check current validity at each select. Checked BAR2
TCM reads/writes and PCI decode/DMA transitions run inside the same invocation
contract, so possession of a retained BAR never authorizes a later access. `Chip::discover` reads the actual
chip ID/revision, walks bounded AI EROM descriptors, and returns discovered
`Core { id, revision, base, wrapper }` records. It performs no writes.
Non-AI interconnects and malformed/out-of-range maps are rejected.
`Chip::discover_ai` shares the bounded EROM walker with SDIO consumers;
those callers validate their own CM3/RAM/D11/SDIO profile. `disable_core`
and `reset_core` implement AI clock/reset/readback ordering with 300-us
assert and 3-ms release deadlines. CYW43439 uses these live helpers; PCIe
BCM43602 CR4 passive/active integration uses these same helpers; CA7 and
other chip-specific lifecycle paths remain gated.

`Chip::park_pcie` masks the PCIe interrupt and mailbox sources before
acknowledging the sampled mailbox status. PCIe core revisions below 64
use offsets 0x24/0x48/0x4c; revisions 64 and above use 0xc14/0xc30/0xc34.
Those offsets are relative to the discovered core, independently of the
firmware shared-memory version. This is interrupt parking, not a reset.

`native_runtime::register_board_profile(BoardProfile)` registers exact PCI
vendor/device/subsystem, discovered chip/revision mask, and verified registry
firmware/NVRAM names before probe. There is no guessed board-calibration
fallback. The native path retains BAR0/BAR2 with Device attributes, resolves
verified firmware capabilities, and starts a retained owner only for an
explicit profile. No built-in profile has been asserted from an untested PCI
ID. Actual platform profile/OTP selection remains a software dependency.

`boot::Cr4<B: boot::Bus>::claim/boot` consumes exclusive backplane/TCM access.
It admits BCM43602 only, halts CR4, disables discovered D11 cores, derives RAM
from CR4 bank registers, applies bank5/7 PDA quirks, checks firmware/NVRAM
nonoverlap, and uploads the reset vector at TCM0 before release. `pack_nvram`
requires a selected single-board file with boardrev, adds the final list NUL,
alignment, and complement token excluding the token bytes. Multi-device
NVRAM is rejected until an actual selector exists. Shared readiness has a
5-second deadline and requires a changed tail sentinel plus aligned RAM-bound
metadata. Firmware RAM hints may shrink, never enlarge discovered RAM.

`runtime::Runtime<B: runtime::Bus>::attach(Booted<B>)` owns five common rings,
eight IOCTL-response buffers, eight event buffers, request input, scratch and
ring-update memory. Shared versions5/6 use checked disjoint TCM metadata and
16-bit indices at 4-byte strides. Nonzero rx_dataoffset descriptor-prefix
geometries and v7 remain gated before any DMA allocation/publication. Optional host DMA-index
fields are cleared to select the supported TCM fallback. All DMA allocations
and host addresses are retained before publication and before enabling BME.

`begin_ioctl`/`take_response` serialize bounded control requests with monotonic
nonwrapping transaction/buffer IDs, zero-filled physical query prefixes,
posted-buffer identity plus command/transaction/interface correlation, and
copy-before-repost. `command(...).await` drives bounded polling with a 2-second
deadline; cancellation poisons the owner and preserves active input bytes.
`poll` consumes at most10 completions per each of three rings (30 total)
per call, so control pressure cannot starve TX/RX; `pop_event` returns owned
event payloads. Stale IDs, malformed extents/indices,
uncorrelated flow/data completion, or bounded event overflow fail-stop the owner
and attempt to disable BME. Native `command` and the 1-ms worker use an async
mutex, with no IRQ lock across awaits. These are live control transport APIs,
not station authorization. The native station owner described below exclusively
consumes this transport when authenticated regulatory policy is available; the old
`connect_wpa2_psk` helper remains an orchestration model.

`enable_data` retains up to32 receive buffers of2048 bytes before publishing
RX32 posts. The native bootstrap calls it before starting the packet worker.
`open_flow(source,destination,priority)` allocates a512×48 flow ring, retains
it before the create request, initializes its TCM indices, and returns a
`FlowToken`. The token is Creating until a matching firmware create completion;
only Open flows admit `send`. Source/destination and priority are immutable.

`send` admits bounded Ethernet-II frames, copies the14-byte Ethernet header
into the TX descriptor and publishes only the remaining body as DMA. At most64
combined outstanding packets/receipts are retained. A matching request ID plus
flow ID and metadata-free classic16-byte TX completion retire exactly one body
mapping after a CPU DMA-read release edge; `pop_tx_receipt` returns its result.
`close_flow` refuses outstanding TX, then waits for the correlated delete ACK.
Create/delete have2-second deadlines driven by the shared poller. At most8 (or
the lower firmware maximum) flow mappings are retained concurrently. A successful
delete ACK after all exact TX completions fences firmware ownership and permits
reusing that retained mapping and hardware ID; failed/timed-out deletes cannot.
`FlowToken` includes a nonwrapping host generation so old software handles cannot
act on a recycled ID. Mappings remain allocated until whole-device quiescence;
recycling does not free DMA based only on PCI command readback.

RX classic32-byte completions validate posted ID, interface, status, Ethernet
format, full16-bit offset/length and buffer bounds. Payload is copied before
posting the same allocation under a fresh nonwrapping ID. `pop_received` returns
owned Ethernet frames; bounded RX queue pressure drops ordinary data and keeps
buffer progress. Unknown/stale completion identity fails the owner. Native
`open_flow`, `flow_state`, `send`, `close_flow`, `pop_received`, and
`pop_tx_receipt` forward to this retained runtime through its async mutex.
These are kernel transport APIs for the control-only owner when regulatory policy
is absent. Once promoted to the station owner, it exclusively owns the runtime;
the native forwarding APIs return Failed/None instead of consuming its replies.
Station authorization and network publication are not implied by a flow token.

`station_transport::Adapter` implements the common `cyw43439::fullmac::Fullmac`
command/event/data contract over real msgbuf rings. Query results are limited to
the caller extent despite a longer iovar-name envelope; SET uses its actual input
extent. It decodes posted vendor event frames, tracks bounded TX deadlines, and
admits Ethernet only after the station's correlated link/key lifecycle authorizes
a peer. Link-down drains exact TX receipts and acknowledged flow deletions before
new-peer traffic. A bounded flow cache evicts idle destinations only through the
same delete-ACK fence.

For an exact registered BCM43602 board profile, native bootstrap loads an existing
authenticated regulatory domain or signed wireless-regulatory.bin, then calls the
common station attach path and publishes a named wireless/net interface only after
firmware initialization. This chip's Linux firmware embeds CLM; no SDIO glom or
external CLM commands are sent. The current shared profile restricts scanning and
joining to authenticated 2.4-GHz channels, Open or firmware-supported WPA2-PSK/CCMP,
a fixed BSSID and roam_off=1. Missing firmware supplicant support rejects WPA2;
there is no host-PSK fallback. Firmware MAC/channels, canonical RSN IE, key/link
events, controlled-port Ethernet-II checks and synchronous bounded network drains
come from the same station implementation as CYW43439. No physical acceptance or
5-GHz/WPA3/AP support is implied.

The `runtime::Memory` contract separates CPU and DMA addresses and requires
cache maintenance plus peripheral barriers at ownership transitions; the
native `DmaBuffer` adapter uses `dmb osh` on aarch64.
`Memory::sync_from_device` performs pre-read cache visibility. A separate
`Memory::release` edge retires CPU DMA reads before TCM consumer-index
publication; the pre-read invalidation/barrier is not a substitute. Drop after any address
publication disables BME best effort and retains every mapping permanently:
config readback alone does not prove all previously posted PCI writes drained.
Recovery/IOMMU quiescence and reclamation are explicit remaining software work.

## 4. Invariants

- No bus mastering without owned DMA mappings, ring lifetimes, and a
  retained terminal ownership. Probe leaves it disabled until explicit
  board firmware/control-ring attachment; all post-publication failures keep
  mappings retained even when BME-disable readback fails.
- Window selection and the subsequent MMIO access have one mutable owner.
  Raw BAR handles are not exposed to concurrent clients.
- Discovery consumes at most 1024 EROM words and retains at most 64 cores.
  Extended address/size descriptors are consumed; a nonzero high address
  word is never truncated into a 32-bit address. Selected register and
  wrapper pages must lie in 0x18000000..0x20000000.
- A map must contain ChipCommon at its expected base and exactly one PCIe2
  core. Duplicate register bases and partial component descriptors fail.
- A gone-device all-ones status is never acknowledged as a live mailbox.
- No await or hardware wait may hold the static controller's IRQ lock.
  Subsequent async firmware/runtime work must move ownership out or use
  an async mutex and scheduler deadlines.

## 5. Architecture notes

The register protocol is architecture independent. `MmioRegion` provides
volatile access and architecture barriers; PCI configuration uses the
capability-checked bus helpers. AI discovery model tests run on both
x86_64 and aarch64; passing them does not establish physical operation.

## 6. Dependencies

Implemented: PCI enumeration/exclusive authority, Device BAR0/BAR2,
BCM43602 bank-derived CR4 boot, explicit verified firmware/NVRAM policy,
shared5/6 TCM indices, retained common/control/flow/RX/TX DMA, bounded correlated
IOCTL/events/data ownership, generation-safe retained flow recycling, shared
station/control-port lifecycle and native probe-to-interface dispatch.

Remaining software dependencies, in activation order:

1. Nonzero descriptor-prefix geometry, actual platform-specific calibration
   policy registrations, board/OTP
   selection for other devices, additional CPU/RAM/chip profiles and shared7.
2. Larger flow profiles, firmware metadata/native802.11 RX modes and broader
   bands/channel widths.
3. Host WPA2 supplicant fallback for firmware without sup_wpa, WPA3/AP support,
   and explicit rekey/recovery replay beyond firmware offload.
4. Confirmed stop/IOMMU quiescence, recovery and DMA reclamation. MSI/IRQ
   operation may replace polling only with the same retained ownership.

These are implementation blockers, not physical-only validation gates.

## 7. Stage assignment

Stage 5 software bring-up. No hardware readiness claim follows from the
PCI match inventory, protocol encoders, or synthetic discovery tests.

## 8. Verification and open questions

Regression fixtures exercise production `Cr4`, `Runtime`, PCI command
transition, `Chip::discover` and `park_pcie` paths using literal Linux-format descriptors. They cover
different discovered PCIe core bases, the revision-64 interrupt-layout
boundary, extended address/size words, aliased/missing cores, invalid
EROM pointers, malformed pairs, absent termination, and gone mailboxes.
Literal CR4 transcripts cover RAM banks/reset-vector/NVRAM/shared readiness;
actual DMA ring fixtures cover request bytes/query zero fill, response and
event correlation/reposting, literal TX/RX wire offsets, full create/TX/delete
state and DMA retirement, wide RX offset/reposting, stale/wrong-flow completions,
control-pressure fairness, invalid indices, cancellation,
and allocation cleanup before versus mapping retention after publication.
