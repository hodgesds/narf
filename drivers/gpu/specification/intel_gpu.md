## 1. Why this is feasible

The 2026 audit confirmed that Intel publishes the per-generation
**Programmer's Reference Manuals (PRMs)** as multi-volume public
PDFs, with the most thorough coverage on older generations and a
narrowing surface as the generation gets newer:

| Generation                | PRM coverage                                         | Verdict                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Tiger Lake (Gen12 Xe-LP)  | full multi-volume PRMs                               | full driver feasible   |
| Alder Lake / Raptor Lake  | full PRMs (Gen12 carries forward)                    | full driver feasible   |
| Meteor Lake (Xe-LPG)      | display + media PRMs published; 3D / compute thinner | display / KMS feasible |
| Lunar Lake (Xe2)          | architecture whitepapers only as of mid-2026        | wait for PRM           |

## 2. Public reference set

- **Intel "Linux Graphics Programmer's Reference Manuals" hub** —
  index + per-generation links.
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/overview.html>
- **Tiger Lake PRM** — the conservative reference target.
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/tiger-lake.html>
- **Alder Lake / DG2 PRM** — same Gen12 register surface, expanded
  for the discrete card; useful cross-check for ADL iGPU work.
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/alder-lake.html>
- **Meteor Lake display PRM** — Xe-LPG display engine.
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/meteor-lake.html>
- **Community PRM mirrors** — useful when chasing older-generation
  references the official site has rotated out.
  <https://kiwitree.net/~lina/intel-gfx-docs/prm/>
  <https://github.com/Igalia/intel-osrc-gfx-prm>
- **VESA DisplayPort 1.4a + eDP 1.5** — already in this repo at
  `graphics/specification/spec.md`. Intel's display engine speaks
  standard DP off the SoC, so PSR / Adaptive-Sync / DSC / DPCD
  programming is shared with our existing DP code.
- **VESA E-EDID 1.4** — used by `narf-graphics::edid`; Intel iGPU
  consumes the same EDID once it's been read out via GMBUS or
  DP-AUX.

## 3. Volume map

Stage-2 work cites Tiger Lake PRM volumes by their public titles.
The volume layout is stable across Gen12 (TGL / ADL / RPL):

| Vol | Title                                | Used by               |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 2a  | Command Reference: Instructions      | (3D — out of scope)   |
| 2c  | Command Reference: Engines           | (3D — out of scope)   |
| 5   | Memory Views                         | `intel_gpu_gtt`       |
| 11  | Display Engine Registers             | `intel_gpu_pll`       |
| 12  | Display DDIs / Plane Programming     | `intel_gpu_ddi`, `intel_gpu_gmbus` |
| 14  | Display Engine                       | `intel_gpu_pipes`     |
| 16  | Workarounds                          | (consult per-bug)     |

Every register cited in a `intel_gpu_*` module names its source
volume + section in a doc-comment so a future maintainer can find
the canonical bit definition without re-deriving it.

## 4. Stage plan

### Stage 1 (landed) — PCI claim + presence test
- `intel_gpu.rs`: vendor `0x8086`, class `0x03`, exact match table
  for documented Gen12 device IDs (TGL-U/H, ADL-S/P, RPL-S/P, MTL-P)
  plus a class-match backstop that filters on vendor.
- BAR0 (GTTMMADR) maps the unified MMIO + GTT window. BAR2 maps
  the stolen-memory frame-buffer aperture on iGPUs.
- Presence test by reading `GMD_ID` (Graphics Media Device
  Identifier, MMIO 0xD8C). All-ones / all-zeros means the BAR is
  mapped but no silicon backs it.
- Records `BoundDriver { name: "intel-gpu", kind: Graphics }` on
  successful probe.

### Stage 2 (landed) — Codec layer
- **`intel_gpu_gmbus`** — GMBUS register file (MMIO 0xC5100..),
  CMD/STATUS bit layout, pin-pair encoding (DDI A..F), 256-byte
  E-EDID read transaction encoder. Source: TGL PRM Vol. 12
  "GMBUS Programming".
- **`intel_gpu_pll`** — DPLL register layout for Gen12 Combo PHY +
  TC PHY: `DPLL_CTRL{1,2,3}`, `DPLL_CFGCR0`, `DPLL_CFGCR1`,
  `DPCLKA_CFGCR0`, `MGPLL_*` divider fields. Source: TGL PRM
  Vol. 11 "Display Clocks".
- **`intel_gpu_pipes`** — pipe + transcoder + plane register
  offsets (`PIPE_*`, `TRANS_*`, `PLANE_*`), `PIPECONF` /
  `PIPE_SRCSZ` / `TRANS_HTOTAL` / `TRANS_VTOTAL` /
  `PLANE_CTL` / `PLANE_SURF` / `PLANE_STRIDE` codecs. Source:
  TGL PRM Vol. 14 "Display Engine".
- **`intel_gpu_ddi`** — DDI port programming: `DDI_BUF_CTL`,
  `DDI_BUF_TRANS_*`, voltage-swing/pre-emphasis tables for DP HBR
  rates, the DDI ↔ transcoder route latch (`TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL`).
  Source: TGL PRM Vol. 12 "Display DDI".
- **`intel_gpu_gtt`** — 64-bit GTT page-table entry layout: phys
  address bits, PRESENT, level-of-cache (LLC eLLC), age policy,
  TC bits. Source: TGL PRM Vol. 5 "Memory Views".

Codec layer is transport-agnostic — it produces the wire
register values without performing the MMIO write. The
Stage-3 driver core consumes these codecs through the
`Transport`-equivalent indirection used elsewhere in narf
(direct MMIO in kernel mode, cap-mediated MMIO in userspace).

### Stage 3 (future) — Display-only driver core
- Wire GMBUS to `narf-graphics::edid::Edid::parse` for EDID
  read-out on whatever DDI the firmware left active.
- Compute pipe / transcoder timing from EDID detailed-timing
  block; program PIPE / TRANS / PLANE through the Stage-2 codec.
- Take over scanout from UEFI GOP without re-training the link
  (modeset to firmware-supplied mode).

### Stage 4 (future) — Frame buffer + KMS
- GTT entry table population from the Stage-2 codec.
- PPGTT page-table walks per the PRM memory model.
- Single-rectangle scanout from a CPU-mapped buffer.

### Stage 5+ (future) — 3D / compute (TGL only)
- Command streamer (RCS0) ring submission.
- Limited 3D pipeline using the public PRM. Out of scope for
  v1; the kernel-resident driver only needs a display surface.

## 5. PCI device ID table

The canonical table lives in code as `intel_gpu::DEVICE_TABLE`;
PCI registration and classification both derive from it, and the
`smoke_device_table_census` fixture pins the code table to this
section. IDs are sourced from the public **`pci.ids`** database
(v2.2, Intel graphics rows). IDs that do not appear in pci.ids
(9A59 / 9AC9 / 9AC0 / 46B2 / 46A2) are **not** listed — an
earlier coverage pass named them in error.

| ASIC (`ChipInfo::asic`) | Device IDs |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| tigerlake (Gen12) | 9A40, 9A49, 9A60, 9A68, 9A70, 9A78 |
| alderlake-p (Gen12) | 4626, 4628, 462A, 4636, 4638, 463A, 46A0, 46A1, 46A3, 46A6, 46A8, 46AA, 46B6, 46B8, 46BA |
| raptorlake-p (Gen12) | 46B0, 46B1, 46B3, A720, A721, A7A0, A7A1, A7A8, A7A9, A7AA, A7AB, A7AC, A7AD |
| alderlake-m (Gen12) | 46C0, 46C1, 46C3 |
| alderlake-n (Gen12) | 46D0, 46D1, 46D2, 46D3, 46D4 |
| alderlake-s (Gen12) | 4680, 4682, 4688, 468A, 468B, 4690, 4692, 4693 |
| raptorlake-s (Gen12) | A780, A781, A782, A783, A788, A789, A78A, A78B |
| meteorlake (Xe-LPG) | 7D40, 7D45, 7D55, 7D60, 7DD5 |
| pantherlake (Xe3-LPG) | B080, B081, B082, B083, B084, B085, B086, B087, B08F, B090, B0A0, B0B0 |

Note: pci.ids labels 46B0/46B1/46B3 as AlderLake-P silicon; the
driver has always classified them `raptorlake-p` and the census
pins that existing behaviour (re-classification is out of scope
for lane 1).

A single class-match backstop (`MatchKind::Class { class: 0x03,
mask: 0xFF }`) catches every PCI VGA controller; the probe body
filters on `vendor == 0x8086` so AMD / NVIDIA / virtio-gpu cards
fall through to their own drivers. An Intel DID outside the
table is announced on the console as an unsupported ASIC and the
probe returns `NotForThisDriver` — it no longer collapses
silently into the same `BadDevice` used for dead hardware.

Display programming is gated to Gen12 (Tiger Lake / Alder Lake /
Raptor Lake). Meteor Lake and Panther Lake rows identify and
announce only; their display engines are tracked in #1016.

## 6. Out of scope

- **Gen9 (Skylake / Kaby Lake / Coffee Lake) and Gen11 (Ice
  Lake / Jasper Lake / Elkhart Lake)** — explicitly out of scope.
  No device IDs are listed for them and none will be added to
  this driver: the codec layer is Gen12-shaped (combo-PHY DPLL,
  universal planes), so those generations would need a separate
  display model, not more table rows.
- Arrow Lake identification (7D41 / 7D51 / 7D67 / 7DD1 in
  pci.ids) — not yet listed; tracked as a follow-on to lane 1.
- Lunar Lake / Battlemage 3D — wait for PRM.
- Discrete Arc (Alchemist / Battlemage) — could plug into the
  same code path but requires the higher Xe-HPG / Xe2-HPG PRM
  set, which is partial today.
- Power/thermal-firmware blob (PUNIT) — opaque, loaded by the
  platform.
- HDCP / content-protection registers — out of scope for the
  KMS-grade driver.

## 7. Lane 1 (#1010) — display correctness core + publication

Landed on top of the Stage-3 modeset orchestrator (Gen12,
DDI A / eDP, single pipe):

- **Routing** — `TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL` (transcoder → DDI bind,
  DP-SST, 8 bpc, port width) and `DPCLKA_CFGCR0` (DPLL0 → DDI,
  two-write select-then-enable at the Gen12 address 0x164280)
  are programmed by the modeset. Neither was written before.
- **DP M/N** — `PIPE_DATA_M1/N1` + `PIPE_LINK_M1/N1` computed
  per TGL PRM Vol. 12 §"Transcoder MN Values" (uncompressed
  SST, N = 2^23, M rounded up; LINK_N written last as the
  hardware update trigger).
- **CDCLK floor** — CDCLK is raised (never lowered) to the
  smallest ladder frequency satisfying the PRM rule
  `pixel rate <= 2 * CDCLK` (CD2X divider 1, pipe A).
- **Watermarks / DBUF allocation** — the PRM's "Display Buffer
  Allocation and Watermark Programming Prior to OS Boot" basic
  programming: 160 DBUF blocks to Pipe A's primary plane,
  level-0 watermark 160 blocks / 2 lines, higher levels off.
  The full latency-based algorithm (pcode mailbox latencies)
  and DBUF_CTL power-request sequencing remain follow-on work.
- **DDI_BUF_TRANS** — the modeset loads the swing table for
  the training start rate before link training and reloads if
  training settles elsewhere. RBR/HBR resolve to the HBR2 table
  (see `intel_gpu_ddi` for the rationale).
- **PLL table corrected** — DPLL_CFGCR0/1 field layouts and the
  four DP coefficient rows now match TGL PRM Vol. 12's
  "DisplayPort Mode PLL Values" for the 19.2/38.4 MHz reference
  family (DCO 8100 MHz for all rates; P/K per rate). The 24 MHz
  family shares the dividers with int 0x151 / frac 0x4000;
  DSSM reference-frequency selection is not yet implemented.
- **PLANE_CTL format pinned** — source-format discriminants
  corrected to the ICL+ 5-bit field values (XRGB_8888 =
  0b01000); fixture-pinned against PRM Vol. 14.
- **Publication** — a probed Gen12 scanout is published to the
  framebuffer console through the same ACTIVE + observer
  protocol the AMD display pipeline uses, and the DRM card
  carries real KMS mode state (CRTC 1, encoder 2 TMDS,
  connector 3 eDP) instead of the identity stub.
