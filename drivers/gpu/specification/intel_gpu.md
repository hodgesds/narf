## 1. Why this is feasible

The 2026 audit confirmed that Intel publishes the per-generation
**Programmer's Reference Manuals (PRMs)** as multi-volume public
PDFs, with the most thorough coverage on older generations and a
narrowing surface as the generation gets newer:

| Generation                | PRM coverage                                         | Verdict                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Tiger Lake (Gen12 Xe-LP)  | full multi-volume PRMs                               | full driver feasible   |
| Alder Lake / Raptor Lake  | full PRMs (Gen12 carries forward)                    | full driver feasible   |
| Meteor Lake (Xe-LPG)      | display + media PRMs published; 3D / compute thinner | display / KMS feasible |
| Lunar Lake (Xe2)          | architecture whitepapers only as of mid-2026        | wait for PRM           |

## 2. Public reference set

- **Intel "Linux Graphics Programmer's Reference Manuals" hub** —
  index + per-generation links.
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/overview.html>
- **Tiger Lake PRM** — the conservative reference target.
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/tiger-lake.html>
- **Alder Lake / DG2 PRM** — same Gen12 register surface, expanded
  for the discrete card; useful cross-check for ADL iGPU work.

- **Meteor Lake display PRM** — Xe-LPG display engine.
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/graphics-for-linux/developer-reference/1-0/meteor-lake.html>
- **Community PRM mirrors** — useful when chasing older-generation
  references the official site has rotated out.
  <https://kiwitree.net/~lina/intel-gfx-docs/prm/>
  <https://github.com/Igalia/intel-osrc-gfx-prm>
- **VESA DisplayPort 1.4a + eDP 1.5** — already in this repo at
  `graphics/specification/spec.md`. Intel's display engine speaks
  standard DP off the SoC, so PSR / Adaptive-Sync / DSC / DPCD
  programming is shared with our existing DP code.
- **VESA E-EDID 1.4** — used by `narf-graphics::edid`; Intel iGPU
  consumes the same EDID once it's been read out via GMBUS or
  DP-AUX.

## 3. Volume map

Stage-2 work cites Tiger Lake PRM volumes by their public titles.
The volume layout is stable across Gen12 (TGL / ADL / RPL):

| Vol | Title                                | Used by               |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 2a  | Command Reference: Instructions      | `intel_gpu_rcs` (MI command codecs) |
| 2c  | Command Reference: Engines           | `intel_gpu_rcs` (execlists / LRC model) |
| 5   | Memory Views                         | `intel_gpu_gtt`, `intel_gpu_rcs` |
| 11  | Display Engine Registers             | `intel_gpu_pll`, `intel_gpu_dp` (HPD) |
| 12  | Display DDIs / Plane Programming     | `intel_gpu_ddi`, `intel_gpu_gmbus`, `intel_gpu_audio` |
| 14  | Display Engine                       | `intel_gpu_pipes`     |
| 16  | Workarounds                          | (consult per-bug)     |

Every register cited in a `intel_gpu_*` module names its source
volume + section in a doc-comment so a future maintainer can find
the canonical bit definition without re-deriving it.

## 4. Stage plan

### Stage 1 (landed) — PCI claim + presence test
- `intel_gpu.rs`: vendor `0x8086`, class `0x03`, exact match table
  for documented Gen12 device IDs (TGL-U/H, ADL-S/P, RPL-S/P, MTL-P)
  plus a class-match backstop that filters on vendor.
- BAR0 (GTTMMADR) maps the unified MMIO + GTT window. BAR2 maps
  the stolen-memory frame-buffer aperture on iGPUs.
- Presence test by reading `GMD_ID` (Graphics Media Device
  Identifier, MMIO 0xD8C). All-ones / all-zeros means the BAR is
  mapped but no silicon backs it.
- Records `BoundDriver { name: "intel-gpu", kind: Graphics }` on
  successful probe.

### Stage 2 (landed) — Codec layer
- **`intel_gpu_gmbus`** — GMBUS register file (MMIO 0xC5100..),
  CMD/STATUS bit layout, pin-pair encoding (DDI A..F), E-EDID
  read transaction encoder, and the MMIO transport (`GmbusBus`):
  poll-counted HW_RDY / wait-phase waits, STOP-cycle +
  wait-idle teardown, SATOER NAK recovery, CYCLE_INDEX /
  GMBUS5 indexed transfers. Register map corrected against
  PRM Vol. 12 + i915 `intel_gmbus_regs.h` in #1018 (base
  0xC5100, GMBUS5 at +0x20, HW_WAIT_PHASE at GMBUS2[14]).
  Source: TGL PRM Vol. 12 "GMBUS Programming".
- **`intel_gpu_pll`** — DPLL register layout for Gen12 Combo PHY +
  TC PHY: `DPLL_CTRL{1,2,3}`, `DPLL_CFGCR0`, `DPLL_CFGCR1`,
  `DPCLKA_CFGCR0`, `MGPLL_*` divider fields. Source: TGL PRM
  Vol. 11 "Display Clocks".
- **`intel_gpu_pipes`** — pipe + transcoder + plane register
  offsets (`PIPE_*`, `TRANS_*`, `PLANE_*`), `PIPECONF` /
  `PIPE_SRCSZ` / `TRANS_HTOTAL` / `TRANS_VTOTAL` /
  `PLANE_CTL` / `PLANE_SURF` / `PLANE_STRIDE` codecs. Source:
  TGL PRM Vol. 14 "Display Engine".
- **`intel_gpu_ddi`** — DDI port programming: `DDI_BUF_CTL`,
  `DDI_BUF_TRANS_*`, voltage-swing/pre-emphasis tables for DP HBR
  rates, the DDI ↔ transcoder route latch (`TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL`).
  Source: TGL PRM Vol. 12 "Display DDI".
- **`intel_gpu_gtt`** — 64-bit GTT page-table entry layout: phys
  address bits, PRESENT, level-of-cache (LLC eLLC), age policy,
  TC bits. Source: TGL PRM Vol. 5 "Memory Views".

Codec layer is transport-agnostic — it produces the wire
register values without performing the MMIO write. The
Stage-3 driver core consumes these codecs through the
`Transport`-equivalent indirection used elsewhere in narf
(direct MMIO in kernel mode, cap-mediated MMIO in userspace).

### Stage 3 (future) — Display-only driver core
- Wire GMBUS to `narf-graphics::edid::Edid::parse` for EDID
  read-out on whatever DDI the firmware left active.
  (The GMBUS transport itself landed in #1018; the session
  wiring into the driver core is the remaining step.)
- Compute pipe / transcoder timing from EDID detailed-timing
  block; program PIPE / TRANS / PLANE through the Stage-2 codec.
- Take over scanout from UEFI GOP without re-training the link
  (modeset to firmware-supplied mode).

### Stage 4 (partially landed) — Frame buffer + KMS
- GTT entry table population from the Stage-2 codec.
- PPGTT page-table walks per the PRM memory model — **landed**
  (§9).
- Single-rectangle scanout from a CPU-mapped buffer.

### Stage 5+ (partially landed) — 3D / compute (TGL only)
- Command streamer (RCS0) ring submission — **landed** as the
  execlists path in `intel_gpu_rcs` (§8). GGTT addressing only.
- Remaining: PPGTT per-context page tables, media engines,
  full 3D pipeline state. Out of scope for v1; the
  kernel-resident driver only needs a display surface plus
  batch submission.

## 5. PCI device ID table

The canonical table lives in code as `intel_gpu::DEVICE_TABLE`;
PCI registration and classification both derive from it, and the
`smoke_device_table_census` fixture pins the code table to this
section. IDs are sourced from the public **`pci.ids`** database
(v2.2, Intel graphics rows). IDs that do not appear in pci.ids
(9A59 / 9AC9 / 9AC0 / 46B2 / 46A2) are **not** listed — an
earlier coverage pass named them in error.

| ASIC (`ChipInfo::asic`) | Device IDs |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| tigerlake (Gen12) | 9A40, 9A49, 9A60, 9A68, 9A70, 9A78 |
| alderlake-p (Gen12) | 4626, 4628, 462A, 4636, 4638, 463A, 46A0, 46A1, 46A3, 46A6, 46A8, 46AA, 46B6, 46B8, 46BA |
| raptorlake-p (Gen12) | 46B0, 46B1, 46B3, A720, A721, A7A0, A7A1, A7A8, A7A9, A7AA, A7AB, A7AC, A7AD |
| alderlake-m (Gen12) | 46C0, 46C1, 46C3 |
| alderlake-n (Gen12) | 46D0, 46D1, 46D2, 46D3, 46D4 |
| alderlake-s (Gen12) | 4680, 4682, 4688, 468A, 468B, 4690, 4692, 4693 |
| raptorlake-s (Gen12) | A780, A781, A782, A783, A788, A789, A78A, A78B |
| meteorlake (Xe-LPG) | 7D40, 7D45, 7D55, 7D60, 7DD5 |
| arrowlake (Xe-LPG) | 7D41, 7D51, 7D67, 7DD1, B640 |
| pantherlake (Xe3-LPG) | B080, B081, B082, B083, B084, B085, B086, B087, B08F, B090, B0A0, B0B0 |

Note: pci.ids labels 46B0/46B1/46B3 as AlderLake-P silicon; the
driver has always classified them `raptorlake-p` and the census
pins that existing behaviour (re-classification is out of scope
for lane 1).

Arrow Lake (#1023): the five IDs classify
`Generation::MeteorLake` under `asic: "arrowlake"` — the table
follows the silicon, not the product name. Arrow Lake's GT is
Xe-LPG and its display is Xe-LPD, and both Linux drivers bind
the IDs to the Meteor Lake platform: i915
`INTEL_ARL_IDS(INTEL_VGA_DEVICE, &mtl_info)` (`i915_pci.c`),
xe `INTEL_ARL_IDS(..., &mtl_desc)` (`xe_pci.c`), and display
`INTEL_ARL_IDS(INTEL_DISPLAY_DEVICE, &mtl_desc)`
(`intel_display_device.c`), with Arrow Lake distinguished
only as a subplatform (ARL-H = 7D51/7DD1, ARL-U = 7D41,
ARL-S = 7D67/B640 in `include/drm/intel/pciids.h`, torvalds/linux
master @ d135ab453a74). This is the Raptor-Lake-under-AlderLake
pattern one generation up. B640 is in the i915 ID macros and
current pci.ids ("Arrow Lake-H") but was absent from the
pci.ids v2.2 extract lane 1 worked from, so it arrives with
this lane; pci.ids and i915 disagree on B640's segment letter
(H vs the S macro), never on the family. The
`smoke_arrowlake_classification` fixture pins the set, the
generation, and the no-bleed boundary against the sibling
Meteor Lake IDs in the shared 0x7Dxx space.

A single class-match backstop (`MatchKind::Class { class: 0x03,
mask: 0xFF }`) catches every PCI VGA controller; the probe body
filters on `vendor == 0x8086` so AMD / NVIDIA / virtio-gpu cards
fall through to their own drivers. An Intel DID outside the
table is announced on the console as an unsupported ASIC and the
probe returns `NotForThisDriver` — it no longer collapses
silently into the same `BadDevice` used for dead hardware.

Display programming is gated to Gen12 (Tiger Lake / Alder Lake /
Raptor Lake). Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Panther Lake rows
identify and announce only; their display engines are tracked
in #1016. Because Arrow Lake shares the `MeteorLake`
classification, it inherits whatever display disposition that
generation carries — when #1016 opens Xe-LPG display for
Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake takes the same path deliberately:
Linux binds its display to the same `mtl_desc` descriptor.

## 6. Out of scope

- **Gen9 (Skylake / Kaby Lake / Coffee Lake) and Gen11 (Ice
  Lake / Jasper Lake / Elkhart Lake)** — explicitly out of scope.
  No device IDs are listed for them and none will be added to
  this driver: the codec layer is Gen12-shaped (combo-PHY DPLL,
  universal planes), so those generations would need a separate
  display model, not more table rows.
- Arrow Lake display — identification landed (#1023, §5);
  display support rides #1016's Xe-LPG family via the shared
  Meteor Lake classification, not a separate Arrow Lake path.
- Lunar Lake / Battlemage 3D — wait for PRM.
- Discrete Arc (Alchemist / Battlemage) — could plug into the
  same code path but requires the higher Xe-HPG / Xe2-HPG PRM
  set, which is partial today.
- Power/thermal-firmware blob (PUNIT) — opaque, loaded by the
  platform.
- HDCP / content-protection registers — out of scope for the
  KMS-grade driver.

## 7. Lane 1 (#1010) — display correctness core + publication

Landed on top of the Stage-3 modeset orchestrator (Gen12,
DDI A / eDP, single pipe):

- **Routing** — `TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL` (transcoder → DDI bind,
  DP-SST, 8 bpc, port width) and `DPCLKA_CFGCR0` (DPLL0 → DDI,
  two-write select-then-enable at the Gen12 address 0x164280)
  are programmed by the modeset. Neither was written before.
- **DP M/N** — `PIPE_DATA_M1/N1` + `PIPE_LINK_M1/N1` computed
  per TGL PRM Vol. 12 §"Transcoder MN Values" (uncompressed
  SST, N = 2^23, M rounded up; LINK_N written last as the
  hardware update trigger).
- **CDCLK floor** — CDCLK is raised (never lowered) to the
  smallest ladder frequency satisfying the PRM rule
  `pixel rate <= 2 * CDCLK` (CD2X divider 1, pipe A).
- **Watermarks / DBUF allocation** — lane 1 programmed the
  PRM's "Display Buffer Allocation and Watermark Programming
  Prior to OS Boot" basics (160 DBUF blocks, one level). Lane
  Q6 (#1024) replaced that with the full latency-based
  algorithm — see the Q6 note below; the pre-boot programming
  remains as the fallback when the pcode latency read fails.
- **DDI_BUF_TRANS** — the modeset loads the swing table for
  the training start rate before link training and reloads if
  training settles elsewhere. RBR/HBR resolve to the HBR2 table
  (see `intel_gpu_ddi` for the rationale).
- **PLL table corrected** — DPLL_CFGCR0/1 field layouts and the
  four DP coefficient rows now match TGL PRM Vol. 12's
  "DisplayPort Mode PLL Values" for the 19.2/38.4 MHz reference
  family (DCO 8100 MHz for all rates; P/K per rate). The 24 MHz
  family shares the dividers with int 0x151 / frac 0x4000;
  lane Q6 (#1024) implemented the DSSM reference-frequency
  selection between the families — see the Q6 note below.
- **PLANE_CTL format pinned** — source-format discriminants
  corrected to the ICL+ 5-bit field values (XRGB_8888 =
  0b01000); fixture-pinned against PRM Vol. 14.
- **Publication** — a probed Gen12 scanout is published to the
  framebuffer console through the same ACTIVE + observer
  protocol the AMD display pipeline uses, and the DRM card
  carries real KMS mode state (CRTC 1, encoder 2 TMDS,
  connector 3 eDP) instead of the identity stub.

### Lane Q6 (#1024) — display follow-ons

- **DBUF_CTL power sequencing** — the modeset requests power
  for both DBUF slices (`DBUF_CTL` S1 0x45008 / S2 0x44FE8,
  POWER_REQUEST bit 31 → POWER_STATE bit 30, addresses and
  fields from the display register volume / i915
  `skl_watermark_regs.h`; they are not in PRM Vol. 12) before
  programming watermarks, and fails the modeset with
  `DbufPowerTimeout` if a slice never grants. The
  tracker-state-service fields are left at firmware values;
  their programming belongs to the MDCLK/CDCLK-ratio and
  joined-MBUS machinery (multi-pipe, #1017).
- **Latency-based watermarks** (`intel_gpu_wm`) — the Gen12
  algorithm: pcode memory latencies (`intel_gpu_pcode`,
  GEN9_PCODE_READ_MEM_LATENCY) sanitised / made monotonic /
  WaWmMemoryReadLatency-adjusted, method1/method2 selection,
  per-level blocks/lines with monotonic clamping,
  min_ddb_alloc validation against the plane's allocation,
  transition watermarks (wm0 + 14), and the SAGV watermark at
  (GEN12_PCODE_READ_SAGV_BLOCK_TIME_US + level-0 latency) in
  the dedicated SAGV registers (Gen12 has 6 regular levels).
  Scope: linear surfaces, one pipe, one plane — the plane
  receives the whole 2048-block DBUF (the degenerate
  single-consumer allocation); per-pipe slice arbitration is
  #1017. If the pcode latency read fails or level 0 is
  unusable, the modeset falls back to lane 1's pre-boot
  programming. SAGV *control* (pcode 0x21) stays with the
  bandwidth manager; this lane only consumes the block time.
- **DSSM reference-clock selection** — `program_dpll` reads
  DSSM (0x51004) bits [31:29] (0 → 24 MHz, 1 → 19.2 MHz,
  2 → 38.4 MHz; reserved encodings fall through to 24 MHz,
  mirroring i915 `icl_readout_refclk`) and picks the matching
  combo-PLL row family: the 24 MHz rows (DCO int 0x151 /
  frac 0x4000) alongside lane 1's 19.2/38.4 MHz rows, with
  identical P/K/Q dividers. The PRM table's intermediate
  rates (2.16 / 4.32 / 6.48 Gbps) use distinct DCO rows and
  are not in the link-training ladder; they remain unencoded.
- **Scripted-DPCD full-modeset fixture** — the modeset tests
  carry a stateful sink model (register file with computed
  status bits, a pcode endpoint, and an AUX engine driving a
  DP training state machine + EDID EEPROM) over which
  `Modeset::modeset()` runs end-to-end: EDID mode returned,
  family-correct CFGCR0, hand-computed watermark words, and
  the TPS1 → TPS3 → off pattern history with the
  sink-requested swing applied. Q4's branch (#1114) grows a
  sibling sink model at the DP-codec layer; the two should be
  unified once both are on main.

## 8. Command submission (Stage 5 — `intel_gpu_rcs`)

The RCS0 execlists engine for Gen12. Compiled only under the
gpu crate's `intel` feature. Public interface:

- `RcsEngine::new(mmio, alloc)` — allocate the engine status
  page, program `RING_HWS_PGA`, adopt the hardware CSB write
  pointer. Generic over `MmioWindow` + `GpuAllocator` so the
  protocol is fixture-drivable without a BAR; production uses
  `BarWindow` + `GgttArena`.
- `create_context() -> ContextId` / `destroy_context(id)` —
  a context owns a 48-page LRC image (register-state template
  on page 1), a 128 KiB ring, and a 1-page HWSP. Handles pack
  slot + generation; a stale handle is `UnknownContext`, never
  an alias. Destroy refuses (`ContextBusy`) while the context
  is loaded or has work queued/in flight.
- `write_batch(dwords) -> BatchBuf` — GGTT batch allocation;
  the batch must end with `MI_BATCH_BUFFER_END`.
- `submit(ctx, batch) -> request id` — appends
  `MI_BATCH_BUFFER_START` (GGTT) + an `MI_STORE_DWORD_IMM`
  breadcrumb (per-context seqno) to the ring, advances the
  image tail, and pumps the execlist ports. The context must
  be idle: this driver never patches an image the hardware
  may be restoring or saving, so re-submitting to a loaded
  context is `ContextBusy` (queued-but-unloaded contexts
  accept further submits and are covered together).
- `poll_completions() -> Vec<CompletedRequest>` — drains the
  Gen12 CSB from the engine status page (promote / preempt /
  complete), retires requests, frees batch allocations, and
  pumps the next ports. `wait_seqno` is the bounded-poll
  wrapper. Production glue: `submit_dwords` /
  `poll_default_completions` attach lazily to the probed
  controller on a default context.
- `attach_ppgtt(ctx, root_phys)` / `detach_ppgtt(ctx)` /
  `ppgtt_root(ctx)` — program a PPGTT root (§9) into the
  context image's PDP3 pair. Idle-context discipline, like
  every image patch here: a loaded or covered context refuses
  with `ContextBusy`; an unaligned or >39-bit root is
  `InvalidPpgttRoot`.

Invariants:

- ELSP writes are always full pairs in hardware order
  (port 1 high/low, port 0 high/low, posting read); a zero
  descriptor marks an empty port.
- Contexts address via GGTT by default: descriptor mode
  Legacy-64B, PDP image fields zero, batch ASI = GGTT. With
  a PPGTT root attached (§9) the PDP3 pair carries the root
  and the hardware walk runs under the context; batch
  allocations remain GGTT-backed and batch ASI stays GGTT
  until a VA-batch consumer lands.
- A context's requests retire strictly in submission order;
  a preempted context's covered requests return to the queue
  front and are resubmitted, never retired early.
- Every allocation (image / ring / HWSP / batch / status
  page) is arena-accounted; destroy and retirement return
  the arena to its prior balance.

Flagged for first-silicon verification (single named
constants in `intel_gpu_rcs`): `CSB_ENTRIES` = 8 (Gen11+
CSB depth), `RCS_IMAGE_PAGES` = 48 (allocation bound above
the hardware image size), and the descriptor Legacy-64B
mode choice.

## 9. PPGTT + GGTT discipline (Stage 4/5 — `intel_gpu_ppgtt`, #1012)

The per-process page-table walker for Gen12, plus the GGTT
installation discipline the issue names. Compiled only under
the gpu crate's `intel` feature. Sources: TGL PRM Vol. 5
§"Memory Views" (walk levels, entry format) and §"GTTMMADR"
(GGTT window layout).

Public interface:

- `Ppgtt::new(mem)` — an empty address space owning one
  allocated PML4 root page. `root_phys()` is the value a
  context programs as its PPGTT root (§8's
  `RcsEngine::attach_ppgtt`).
- `map(mem, va, phys, pat, executable)` / `unmap(mem, va)` —
  4 KiB leaf mappings over the 48-bit VA space (levels
  PML4 → PDPT → PD → PT, 512 entries per table). Double
  mapping is `AlreadyMapped`; unmapping an absent VA is
  `NotMapped`. Intermediate tables are created on first use
  and freed when an unmap leaves them empty.
- `translate(mem, va) -> WalkOutcome` — the hardware walk,
  CPU-side: `Mapped(phys)`, `NotMapped { level }`, or
  `Corrupt { level }`. Present-but-malformed entries
  (reserved bits outside the level's documented encoding, or
  a zero physical address) are never followed.
- `teardown(mem)` — frees every owned table page; leaf
  frames are the caller's and are never freed by the walker.
- `PtMemory` — the table-page seam, addressed physically
  exactly as the hardware walk is. Production is
  `FramePtMemory` (host frames, direct-map CPU access);
  fixtures model system RAM and cross-check translations
  against an independent reference walk written from the PRM
  level definition.
- GGTT discipline in `intel_gpu_gtt`: `ggtt_va_size(bar_len)`
  derives the GGTT size from the actual GTTMMADR BAR length
  (16 MiB BAR → 4 GiB GGTT); every scanout mapping is
  bounds-checked against it (`GttError::OutOfBounds`) before
  any write, and every PTE write burst ends with
  `flush_ggtt_writes` (fence + readback of the last slot).

Invariants:

- A `Ppgtt` owns exactly the tables it allocated —
  `table_pages()` and the allocator's `live_tables()` agree
  at every public boundary, including after a map that fails
  partway (`OutOfMemory` leaves a well-formed partial chain).
- The walker never writes a leaf or intermediate entry it did
  not encode itself from validated inputs; foreign entries it
  cannot validate stop the walk as `Corrupt`, on both the
  translate and map paths.
- Context integration is one-directional: the RCS engine
  programs a root the walker produced; the walker knows
  nothing of contexts. Batch submission through a PPGTT (VA
  batches) is not claimed here — batches remain GGTT-backed
  (§8); the media lane (#1022) is the named consumer that
  builds on per-context PPGTT.

Flagged for first-silicon verification: in 4-level mode the
execlists context's PDP3 pair carries the PML4 root (as a
table entry, `phys | PRESENT`) and PDP0–PDP2 stay zero — the
encoding `attach_ppgtt` writes (§8). It is a single patch
site in `intel_gpu_rcs` if bring-up shows otherwise.


## 10. eDP panel power sequencing + PSR (Stage 5 — `intel_gpu_edp`, #1020)

The internal-panel counterpart of the external-DP path
(§7 + Q4's session work): the eDP panel on DDI A is powered
by the PPS block and kept in Panel Self Refresh between
updates. Compiled only under the gpu crate's `intel`
feature. Sources: eDP 1.4b (DPCD field map, via
`drm_dp.h`), TGL PRM Vol. 2c + Vol. 12 displays volumes
(PPS/PSR register map and field encodings), with
`intel_pps.c` / `intel_psr.c` (+ their `*_regs.h`) from
Linux i915 read as cross-checks of the flows, not as the
source of the constants.

Public interface:

- `PanelPowerSequencer` — the PPS conversation over an
  `MmioWindow`. `new` adopts firmware-programmed delay
  fields verbatim; only zero fields (and the T8/T9 fields,
  which are forced to 1 because the waits run in software)
  fall back to the eDP spec's upper-limit defaults
  (`PanelDelays::SPEC_DEFAULTS`: T1+T3 210 ms, T8/T9 50 ms,
  T10 500 ms, T11+T12 610 ms). `init_registers` programs the
  delay registers and the PP_CONTROL cycle-delay field
  (100 ms granularity on CNP+ PCH — there is no PP_DIVISOR).
  `power_on` enforces the power cycle (status-side
  IDLE_CYCLE poll plus the software remainder of T11+T12
  from the recorded power-off stamp) before setting
  PANEL_POWER_ON, then waits for the on-idle state;
  `vdd_on`/`vdd_off` are the TCON/VDD discipline;
  `backlight_on`/`backlight_off` gate EDP_BLC_ENABLE with
  T8/T9 observed in software. A panel that misses its
  on-idle budget is left powered-down (power target and
  VDD-force cleared) with a typed `PpsError`; the backlight
  gate never opens for an unpowered panel.
- `PsrCaps::probe` — one burst read of DPCD 0x070..0x074
  plus the sync-latency byte at 0x2009. Support 0 or a
  reserved value (>4) declines as `Ok(None)` — plain eDP,
  zero PSR traffic. A claiming panel with a reserved
  setup-time code (7) is refused with a typed error.
  Granularity bytes are honoured only when the sink
  requires programmed granularity; zero fields fall back
  to 4×4 rather than propagating a divide-by-zero.
- `psr_enable` / `psr_disable` — the enable conversation:
  entry-setup validity is checked against the mode's
  vertical blanking before any write; PSR2 programs the
  sink (ALPM_CONFIG, then PSR_EN_CFG, then SET_POWER D0),
  writes PSR1's CTL disabled, then PSR2_CTL + MAN_TRK in
  continuous full frame. PSR2 falls back to PSR1 when the
  mode's scanlines make the BSpec wake times (42/45 µs)
  exceed 12 lines. PSR1 programs EN_CFG 0x07
  (ENABLE|MAIN_LINK_ACTIVE|CRC) + SET_POWER D0, then the
  source CTL. TP intervals use the conservative 2500 µs
  bucket (no VBT in this driver); idle frames follow
  i915's formula `max(6, sink_sync_latency + 1)`, frames
  before SU `max(sink_sync_latency + 1, 2)` (+1 past the
  entry-setup count). Disable runs source-first, then
  clears the sink byte.
- The runtime seam — `runtime_install_panel`,
  `runtime_install_psr`, `set_flip_pending`,
  `notify_scanout_dirty`, `on_scanout_published` — is how
  the framebuffer publish path drives PSR: a scanout
  publish notifies a full-frame update (which is what
  exits PSR), a region notify drives PSR2 selective
  update, and nothing polls. A notify while a flip is
  pending is refused before any register write. Probe
  wiring: PPS runs first inside the display block of
  `intel_gpu::probe` (a failed sequence skips backlight
  install, takeover, and the scanout move entirely), PSR
  is attempted once a real mode exists, and
  `publish_scanout` calls `on_scanout_published` with no
  locks held. `panel_power_off` composes the shutdown:
  registered backlight brightness to zero
  (`narf_drivers_backlight::panel_owner`, the #1037
  composition seam), PSR disable, then the PPS T9 → T10
  sequence.

Invariants:

- The MAN_TRK value for a partial update encodes exactly
  the granularity-aligned dirtied region (outward-aligned
  to the sink's SU granularity, TGL additionally to
  4 lines) — never the full frame. The fixture suite
  asserts both platform encodings byte-for-value.
- No PSR register or DPCD byte is written for a panel that
  did not claim PSR, and no PPS step is skipped: cycle
  delay before power-on, T8 before the backlight gate,
  backlight gate closed (and T9 observed) before power
  drops.
- Lock order is CONTROLLER → EDP_RUNTIME; the runtime
  lock is never held across an AUX transaction or a
  console write, and the MMIO window passed to
  `notify_scanout_dirty` is caller-built from the BAR
  (same discipline as takeover's adapter).

Composition points and named omissions:

- PSR2 selective fetch's plane registers
  (PLANE_SEL_FETCH_*) belong to lane 1's plane-programming
  surface; MAN_TRK is the SU discipline implemented here,
  and sel-fetch composition lands with the plane lane.
- ADL-P stepping workaround Wa_22012278275 (scrambled
  early-transport map) is not applied: this driver has no
  stepping readout yet.
- Sink sync latency is read from the last-actual field of
  DP_SYNCHRONIZATION_LATENCY_IN_SINK (bits [7:4]); i915's
  max-latency field (bits [3:0]) is the alternative —
  flagged for first-silicon verification, as is the
  PCH PPS base (0xC7200) on the south-display SKUs this
  queue covers.

## 11. Forcewake domains (Stage 5 — `intel_gpu_forcewake`, #1013)

Register access under GT power gating. Compiled only under
the gpu crate's `intel` feature. Forcewake is the driver's
lever on the per-block power gates that sit in front of most
GT registers; it is distinct from the display power wells
(§7's PG1/PG2 machinery), which power the display block and
take no forcewake. Sources: the i915 uncore layer
(`intel_uncore.c`, `i915_reg.h`) — the authoritative
restatement of the PRM Vol. 12 forcewake registers.

Register map (Gen9-named, used for the Gen11/Gen12 domain
table): request registers `FORCEWAKE_BLITTER` = 0xA188 (the
legacy FORCEWAKE_MT register), `FORCEWAKE_MEDIA` = 0xA270,
`FORCEWAKE_RENDER` = 0xA278; ack registers render 0x0D84,
media 0x0D88, blitter 0x130044. The request bit is
`FORCEWAKE_KERNEL` = BIT(0); BIT(1) is another requestor's
(`FORCEWAKE_USER`). Writes are masked (value in the low
half, per-bit write mask in the high half), so one requestor
never disturbs another's bits.

Public interface:

- `Forcewake::new()` — per-domain hold counts (render,
  blitter, media), no window owned; every operation takes
  the caller's `&M: MmioWindow`, so the manager composes
  with any register path (engine window, production
  `BarWindow`, fixture).
- `acquire(regs, domain)` / `release(regs, domain)` —
  refcounted holds. Only the 0→1 transition programs the
  request (masked-enable + ack wait); only the 1→0
  transition programs the clear (masked-disable + ack-clear
  wait). `with_domain(regs, domain, f)` is the scoped form.
- `sanitize(regs)` — probe-time reset mirroring i915's
  `fw_domain_reset`: masked-clear of all request bits in
  every domain, counts zeroed, no ack waits (a domain's
  well may not exist on fused-off parts).

Invariants:

- A domain is never dropped under another holder: nested
  acquires generate exactly one hardware request, and the
  clear is programmed only at the last release.
- No leaked hold on timeout: if the ack never sets — after
  the one clear→set re-kick i915 documents for the
  lost-ack quirk (the driver's request colliding with the
  hardware's own wake requests) — acquire rolls the
  request back off and errors with the count still zero.
- An ack-clear timeout on release is reported, but the
  hold is dropped: the request is off and the hardware is
  merely slow to gate (the safe direction).
- Ack waits are poll-counted (`ACK_POLL_BUDGET` = 100 000
  polls ≫ i915's `FORCEWAKE_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS` = 50 at
  silicon MMIO-read cost), never wall-clock deadlines, so
  fixtures that model ack latency in polls are
  deterministic under TCG.

Composition: the RCS production glue
(`intel_gpu_rcs::submit_dwords`) carries a `Forcewake` in
the default engine's state, sanitized at attach, and runs
each submission inside a render-domain hold — the RCS0
register conversation is the GT access the PRM gates.
`poll_default_completions` takes no hold (the CSB lives in
host memory, not a gated register); probe's presence reads
are always-on-block reads and stay unwrapped. Deliberate
divergence from i915: the clear is programmed immediately
at the last release rather than deferred ~1 ms by timer —
a host-OS batching optimisation, not hardware protocol.

Out of scope here: the per-engine media sub-domains
(VDBOX/VEBOX) belong to the media-engines work (#1022);
RC6 residency policy builds on these holds (#1014).

## 12. RC6 + DMC (Stage 5 — `intel_gpu_rc6`, `intel_gpu_dmc`, #1014)

Idle power for the GT and the display: RC6 (the GT's deep
idle state, host-programmed thresholds + park/unpark
discipline) and the DMC firmware machinery (container
parse/validate, program load, and the DC5/DC6 handoff the
loaded program enables). Compiled only under the gpu
crate's `intel` feature. Sources: i915's
`gt/intel_rc6.c`, `gt/intel_gt_regs.h`,
`gt/intel_engine_regs.h`, `display/intel_dmc.c`,
`display/intel_dmc_regs.h` and
`display/intel_display_regs.h` — the authoritative
restatement of the PRM power registers and the DMC
firmware format (torvalds/linux master, 2026-10-27).

RC6 register map: `GEN6_RC_CONTROL` = 0xA090,
`GEN6_RC_STATE` = 0xA094, wake-rate limits 0xA09C /
0xA0A0, evaluation interval 0xA0A8, idle hysteresis
0xA0AC, `GEN6_RC_SLEEP` = 0xA0B0, `GEN6_RC6_THRESHOLD` =
0xA0B8, PG idle hysteresis 0xA0C4 / 0xA0C8,
`GEN9_PG_ENABLE` = 0xA210, residency counter
`GEN6_GT_GFX_RC6` = 0x138108 (32-bit, 1.28 µs units on
Gen11/12). The enable sequence is `gen11_rc6_enable`'s:
wake-rate limits (54≪16|85, media 150), evaluation
interval 125000, hysteresis 25, `RING_MAX_IDLE` = 10 per
present engine, RC sleep 0, threshold 50000, media/render
PG hysteresis 60, then `GEN9_PG_ENABLE` = render + media
+ media-sampler coarse gating plus per-VCS VDN HCP/MFX
bits — all under FORCEWAKE_ALL. NARF has no GuC, so the
host owns RC6: the control value is
`HW_ENABLE | RC6_ENABLE | EI_MODE(1)` = 0x8804_0000
(i915's host-owned form). The one omitted write from
i915's sequence is `GUC_MAX_IDLE_COUNT` — it programs
the GuC's idle policy, there is no GuC to consume it, and
its offset could not be grounded from the sources
consulted; the omission is deliberate, not an oversight.
Park writes `RC6_ENABLE` alone plus target state 4
(normal RC6) in `RC_STATE` [18:16]; unpark restores the
full control value; disable/sanitize zero PG_ENABLE,
RC_CONTROL and RC_STATE (the `__intel_rc6_disable`
conversation).

DMC format: CSS header (128 bytes; `module_type` 0x09,
`header_ver` 0x10000, firmware version at dword 22),
package header (version 1 ≤ 20 / version 2 ≤ 32 FW-info
entries; the table always occupies the max count;
`num_entries` clamps), FW-info stepping match with `'*'`
wildcards, first match per id wins. Program headers:
signature 0x40403E3E; versions 1 (128-byte header,
`header_len` in *bytes*, ≤ 8 MMIO pairs, payload loads
at 0x80000) and 3 (256-byte header, `header_len` in
dwords, ≤ 20 pairs, explicit start address). Gen12
payload ceiling 0x6000 bytes. MMIO init addresses and v3
load windows are sanity-ranged per id (main program
0x80000–0x86FFF; pipe A 0x90000–0x96FFF; pipe B
0x98000–0x9EFFF). Event handlers: 8 per DMC on Gen12,
EVT_HTP at reg-base +0x004 / EVT_CTL at +0x034 (main
0x8F000; pipes 0x92000 + 0x400·(id−1)); the disabled
EVT_CTL encoding is TYPE=EDGE_0_1 | EVENT=FALSE =
0x0003_0100, and `evt_ctl_disable` preserves only the
sticky ENABLE bit. Load (`dmc_load_program`): handler
sweep → payload dword stream → MMIO table, per program,
then the DC_STATE_DEBUG mask bits (CORES | MEMORY_UP)
plus a posting read. Load-time transforms: pipe event
entries always written disabled; on the main DMC the
CLK_MSEC and VBLANK_DELAYED_A handlers written disabled;
at *parse* time the TGL fixup rewrites a main-DMC
VBLANK_A handler pair to VBLANK_DELAYED_A (shipped
firmware erratum). DC handoff: `DC_STATE_EN` = 0x45504,
target field [1:0] (1 = DC5, 2 = DC6); TGL DC5/DC6 entry
counters at 0x101084 / 0x101088.

Public interface:

- `Rc6::{sanitize, enable, disable}` — the conversations
  above, bracketed by FORCEWAKE_ALL holds on the caller's
  `Forcewake` (acquire render→blitter→media, release in
  reverse; a failed acquire rolls back and changes no
  state). `enable` takes the present engines' register
  bases plus the VCS count — production is `&[RCS_BASE]`,
  0 today.
- `Rc6::{park, unpark}` — the activity discipline.
  `unpark`'s control write runs inside a render hold.
  `park` is refused (`DomainsHeld`) while *any* domain is
  held and (`NotEnabled`) before enable; a refused park
  writes nothing.
- `Rc6Residency::{update, sample}` — wrap-safe delta
  accumulation (×1280 ns) of the hardware counter; the
  first sample primes. `sample` reads under a render
  hold.
- `parse_dmc_firmware(blob, stepping, substepping,
  max_fw_size)` — pure validation → `DmcFirmware`
  (payloads borrowed from the blob; per-slot programs;
  `skipped_mask`). No MMIO: refusal means nothing was
  written anywhere.
- `load_program` / `disable_program` / `verify_loaded` —
  the load conversation over the caller's window;
  verification is i915's `assert_dmc_loaded` as an error
  return (program-RAM first dword + every MMIO entry,
  post-transform).
- `set_dc_target(fw, DcTarget)` — RMW of `DC_STATE_EN`'s
  field; DC5/DC6 refused (`NoMainProgram`) with no main
  program loaded.

Invariants:

- RC6 is never armed under a forcewake hold: the park
  refusal reads the live hold counts, so a submission
  inside its render hold cannot be gated away mid-flight,
  and park succeeds again the moment holders drain.
- The DMC parser never partially succeeds into hardware:
  it is pure, and every refusal (truncation, bad
  signature/module type/version, MMIO or load-address
  range escape, oversize or empty payload) precedes any
  register write. Pipe-program defects degrade to an
  empty slot (i915's tolerance); main-program defects are
  hard errors.
- Where this implementation is stricter than i915 it
  says so in the code: the DMC signature and CSS
  module-type/version are enforced (i915's current parser
  does not check them; the format documents both as
  constants), and PIPEC/PIPED programs are skipped rather
  than range-checked against an ungrounded Gen12 window
  (their skip is recorded in `skipped_mask`).
- Residency totals are monotonic across counter wrap by
  construction (wrapping-sub deltas); no clock is
  consulted anywhere in this section's paths, so fixtures
  are deterministic under TCG.

Composition: both modules own no window and compose over
the caller's `&M: MmioWindow` + `Forcewake` — the seam
§11 designed for. No new initcalls and no change to the
registered-initcall census: these are library state
machines the controller (and the future runtime-PM lane)
compose next to the RCS engine's forcewake state. The
firmware blob arrives as a byte slice; sourcing blobs
from storage is the platform's business, not this
module's.

Out of scope here: GuC-owned RC and `GUC_MAX_IDLE_COUNT`
(no GuC in NARF); RC6p/RC6pp (absent on Gen12); runtime
event-handler reconfiguration (PSR/DCB routing belongs
to the display pipeline); DC3CO/DC9 targets; ADL-P
(display 13) pipe-DMC ranges; wiring park/unpark to GT
activity (the runtime-PM lane consumes this interface).

## 13. Suspend/resume + D-states (Stage 5 — `intel_gpu_pm`, #1015)

System power for the GPU: the device-PM quiesce/D3/restore
conversation, honest PCI D-state reporting (the DRM card's
`power_state()` was a hardcoded `"D0"`), and the S4 state
hook that carries the configuration through the suspend
service's sealed image. Compiled only under the gpu crate's
`intel` feature. Sources: PCI Bus Power Management
Interface Specification rev 1.2 §3.2.4 (PMCSR) and §5.4
(10 ms D3 settle), as implemented by `narf_bus::pci`
(`power_state` / `set_power_state`, Linux
`pci_raw_set_power_state` semantics: preserve all PMCSR
fields but PowerState, write 0 to the RW1C PME_Status
bit); the power-suspend design (`SuspendStateHook`
contract, §5.2 rule 1–5) from `power/specification/
spec.md` §3.3; §§11–12 of this document for the forcewake
and RC6/DMC conversations composed here.

### 13.1 Registration and census

At probe success (Gen12-class parts only — the predicate
is `region_generation() == Some(RegionGeneration::Gen12)`;
Xe-LPG has a region map and display engine since #1016 but
no modelled forcewake/RC6/DMC programming, so it stays
excluded), probe
retains its `(BusDevice, Cap)` in the PM module and
registers, both under the name `"intel-gpu"`: a
`device_pm` ops pair (S3 fan-out) and a `SuspendStateHook`
(S4 seal/unseal). Registration is a probe-time call, not
an initcall: **no new initcalls, census unchanged.**
Runtime modesets (future lanes) must call
`note_active_mode` when they change the active mode, or
resume re-lights the stale one.

### 13.2 Snapshot format (`PmSnapshot::to_bytes`)

Header (18 bytes): magic `"NARFIPM1"`, version u16 = 1,
total length u32, payload length u32. Payload: seq u64;
flags u8 (bit0 has-mode, bit1 has-scanout, bit2
RC6-enabled, bit3 DMC-present); DC target field bits u8;
pre-suspend D-state bits u8; DMC program mask u8 (bit i =
`DmcId::ALL[i]` present); RC6 residency raw counter u32;
then, if has-mode, the `Mode` (pixel clock u32, eight
timing u16s in struct order, sync-polarity u8); then, if
has-scanout, width/height/stride/gtt_offset u32s and
phys_base u64. Trailer: CRC-32/ISO-HDLC (check value
0xCBF43926 for `"123456789"`) over all preceding bytes.
Parsing is fail-closed: magic, version, exact length
agreement, CRC, field sanity (DC bits ≤ 2, D-state bits
≤ 3, nonzero mode geometry with totals ≥ actives), and no
trailing payload — any failure refuses the whole snapshot
and nothing from it is applied. The S4 copy is additionally
AEAD-sealed by the suspend service; the CRC guards the
in-RAM S3 copy and the framing, not an attacker.

### 13.3 Sequences and failure discipline

Suspend: close the RCS submission gate (new submissions
refuse with `SubmitError::Suspended`) → drain completions
until the engine is idle (budget: 100 000 polls — a count,
not a deadline) → snapshot → forcewake sanitize → park
RC6 if enabled (the drain proved zero submission-scoped
holds exist, so park's `DomainsHeld` refusal cannot fire)
→ PMCSR D3hot + 10 ms settle. A drain that never converges
refuses with `Busy` before any power register is touched:
gate reopened, no snapshot, device fully live. Any later
failure before the D3 write rolls back the same way (a
failed D3 write additionally unparks).

Resume: PMCSR D0 + settle → **readback must report D0**,
else the device is named `Degraded(HardwareRestore)` and
the gate stays closed (a retry from that phase is legal)
→ forcewake sanitize → DMC reload + `verify_loaded` + DC
target restore → RC6 re-enable if the snapshot had it →
display re-light: `relight_display` allocates a *fresh*
scanout and re-runs the real modeset at the snapshot mode
(GGTT PTEs do not survive D3; the pre-suspend surface is
never restored in place). The modeset's EDID readback may
apply the panel's preferred mode instead of the saved
fallback — the same behaviour as probe takeover; the
returned scanout follows the applied mode. Each subsystem
restore is attempted even if an earlier one degrades, and
the phase names the first missing piece:
`Degraded(SnapshotInvalid | UnverifiedRestore |
HardwareRestore | DisplayRelight | DmcRestore)`. With no
trusted snapshot, resume re-establishes from driver-owned
state (and reconciles the software RC6 flag via the
disable conversation — D3 reset the hardware underneath
it).

The hook is **not critical**: `seal` serializes the
snapshot from the device suspend (the service runs the
seal fan-out after device quiesce); `unseal` records
Verified/Missing/Invalid; `reconcile_after_unseal` then
acts — a verified blob replaces the restore source
pre-resume or re-applies its display state post-resume, a
missing/invalid blob revokes the RAM snapshot's trust
(pre-resume) or forces re-establishment from driver state
(post-resume, named `Degraded(UnverifiedRestore)`). All
GPU state is reconstructible, so a failed blob must never
abort a resume (design §5.2 rule 4 reserves criticality
for irreconstructible state).

### 13.4 Named remainders

DMC firmware sourcing: `register_dmc_firmware` is the
seam (parse-validated at registration, wildcard stepping
selection — probe's `ChipInfo` carries no stepping
readout in this tree); no production caller fetches a
blob yet, so the reload path is fixture-proven and inert
until the probe-time fetch lands. RC6 enable-at-probe is
likewise a wiring step: the PM core owns the `Rc6`
lifecycle (snapshotted posture, park, re-enable), and
today nothing enables RC6 at probe, so in production the
snapshot's RC6 bit is currently always off. D3cold is not
used (the bus layer supports D3hot only; the link stays
up and config survives). PSR/DC-state runtime policy and
S0ix are out of scope.

## 14. External DisplayPort, full single-stream (lane Q4 — `intel_gpu_dp`, #1092)

The external-DP path for combo DDIs A/B/C, Gen12. Compiled
only under the gpu crate's `intel` feature. Sources: VESA
DisplayPort 1.4a (§2.7 AUX, §2.7.6 I²C-over-AUX, §3.5 link
training, DPCD receiver-capability field), TGL PRM Vol. 11
(PLL table, HPD block) and Vol. 12 (DDI, audio), CEA-861-D
§7.5 (ELD).

Public interface:

- `probe_sink(mmio, ddi) -> DpSinkProbe` — the AUX
  conversation: DPCD capabilities, the *complete* EDID (base +
  extension blocks), and link negotiation for the preferred
  mode. No display registers are touched beyond AUX.
- `activate(mmio, probe, fb) -> DpConnection` — modeset at
  the negotiated plan (`Modeset::modeset_with_plan`), then
  display-audio publication. `connect` composes the two.
- `disconnect(mmio, conn)` — audio disable + sink clear, then
  pipeline teardown. `retrain(mmio, conn, fb)` answers an
  IRQ_HPD short pulse: the connection stands if every trained
  lane still reports CR_DONE, else a fresh connect runs.
- `HpdMonitor` / `poll_hpd_event` — GEN8 DE Port block
  (ISR 0x44440, IMR 0x44444, IIR 0x44448, IER 0x4444C; combo
  hotplug bits at `1 << (3 + ddi_index)`). Level rise/fall is
  Connect/Disconnect; a latched IIR bit on a steady high level
  is the DP short pulse → `RetrainRequired`. Production glue
  in `intel_gpu::poll_dp_hpd_events` drains events, allocates
  the scanout (probe's allocator/lifetime), and publishes
  through the §7 ACTIVE + observer protocol.

Two seams are defined here for named consumers:

- **Shared link-training core** —
  `dp_link_training::{read_caps, negotiate, train_negotiated}`
  (with `DpcdCaps`, `SourceCaps`, `NegotiatedLink`): the
  vendor-neutral caps + negotiation + training composition
  over `dp_aux::AuxChannel`. Negotiation policy: lanes first
  (largest mutually supported of 4/2/1), then the lowest rate
  whose 8b/10b payload covers the stream demand, capped by
  both sides; an uncoverable demand settles at the mutual
  ceiling with `over_budget` reported. **Thunderbolt lane 3
  (#1095) consumes this seam** over tunnelled AUX and must not
  re-implement it.
- **Shared display-audio sink** —
  `narf_drivers_sound::display_audio`: `build_eld` turns a
  complete EDID into the CEA-861 ELD publication (layout
  field-checked against the HDA codec's own ELD parser);
  `publish_display_audio` / `clear_display_audio` /
  `current_display_audio` are the registry. **HDMI-full
  (#1019) consumes this seam** as second publisher (same sink
  id per physical connector: DDI index + 1). The Intel codec
  side (`intel_gpu_audio`: AUD_CONFIG DP timestamp update,
  AUD_PIN_ELD_CP_VLD output-enable / ELD-valid sequencing per
  `hsw_audio_codec_enable/disable`) raises ELD_VALID only
  after the ELD is published in the sink.

Modeset plan path (`Modeset::modeset_with_plan`): the DPLL
is programmed at the negotiated rate, M/N and the
`TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL` port width carry the planned rate/lanes,
and if the fallback ladder settles elsewhere the DPLL, M/N,
port width and BUF_TRANS are reprogrammed to the trained
configuration before the DDI buffer enables. The legacy eDP
path (`Modeset::modeset`) is byte-for-byte unchanged.

Invariants:

- Every DPCD read on the wire requests exactly the byte count
  its caller waits for. (Found defect, fixed in this lane:
  `dp_aux::AuxChannel::dpcd_read` and the `dp_edid` chunk
  reads passed an empty length placeholder, so over the Intel
  MMIO transport every multi-byte read failed reply-length
  decode and EDID readback silently fell back to the
  hardcoded mode. The per-address test stubs that ignored the
  request length masked it; the composed transport+sink
  fixtures here are the regression pin.)
- EDID-over-AUX is one I²C read transaction per 128-byte
  block: offset write, then 16-byte bursts with MOT clear on
  all but the final burst (MOT set = STOP). Extension blocks
  are fetched per the base block's byte 126; blocks past the
  first 256-byte segment would need the I²C 0x30 segment
  pointer, which is not driven (the CTA block is extension 1).
- The plan path programs the DPLL at the negotiated rate
  under the DSSM-selected reference family (lane Q6, #1024 —
  `decode_refclk_family` + `combo_coeffs(rate, family)`), the
  same resolver the legacy path uses; both PRM families
  (19.2/38.4 MHz and 24 MHz) are fixture-pinned there.
- Audio is published only when the sink's CTA extension
  carries at least one SAD; a sink without audio gets video
  only, and disconnect always clears the publication before
  the pipeline comes down.

Deliberate remainders: DP MST and multi-pipe (#1017),
Xe-LPG display (#1016), Type-C HPD via the GEN11 DE HPD block
(the Alt-Mode bridge's DDIs), DSC/FEC, and the HPD IRQ
handler itself (interrupt enables are programmed; the
session is poll-driven until an IRQ consumer lands).

## 15. External HDMI, full (lane Q5 — `intel_gpu_hdmi`, #1019)

The external-HDMI path for combo DDIs, Gen12. Compiled
only under the gpu crate's `intel` feature. Sources: HDMI
1.4 §5.3.5 and CTA-861 infoframe packing (as implemented
by Linux `drivers/video/hdmi.c`), HDMI 2.0 §10 (SCDC; the
register map as carried by `drm_scdc_helper.h`), TGL PRM
Vol. 2c (TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL HDMI bits), Vol. 11 (WRPLL —
the `cnl_ddi_calculate_wrpll` search i915 uses for HDMI on
CNL and ICL+), Vol. 12 (DIP banks, AUD_CONFIG), CEA-861-D
§7.5 (ELD, via the §14 sink).

Public interface:

- `probe_sink(mmio, ddi) -> HdmiSinkProbe` — the complete
  EDID over DDC, the preferred mode, the HDMI Forum VSDB
  capabilities, and whether the mode's character rate
  demands scrambling. No display registers are touched.
- `activate(mmio, probe, fb) -> HdmiConnection` — SCDC
  configuration where required, the WRPLL modeset
  (`Modeset::modeset_hdmi`), the AVI infoframe, then
  display-audio publication. `connect` composes the two.
- `disconnect(mmio, conn)` — audio disable + sink clear,
  DIP disable, pipeline teardown.

DDC runs over the **GMBUS codec** (`intel_gpu_gmbus`): the
base EDID block uses the codec's own read program verbatim;
indexed and segment-pointer reads, and the SCDC writes,
compose the codec's field helpers — no second DDC
transport. The session drives the codec's documented
caller sequence (program GMBUS0/GMBUS1, poll GMBUS2 via
`GmbusStatus`, drain/fill GMBUS3, restore GMBUS0 = 0)
directly, because Q3 (#1018) has not landed a transport
yet; when it does, the engine functions in
`intel_gpu_hdmi` are the swap-out point. The GMBUS_BASE
correction (0xC510 → 0xC5100) and the duplicated GMBUS2
HW_DONE bit are #1018's and are not duplicated here — the
session and its fixtures key off the codec's constants,
never a private copy of the base.

Character-rate rule (HDMI 2.0 §10.4): at 8 bpc the TMDS
character rate of a mode is its pixel clock. Above
340 Mcsc the stream requires SCDC scrambling and the 1/40
TMDS bit-clock ratio, plus both TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL HDMI
bits (Scrambling Enabled bit 0, High TMDS Char Rate
bit 4); the PLL still runs at 5× the character rate (the
1/40 ratio divides the bit clock, not the character-rate
clock). At or below 340 Mcsc the sink is not touched over
SCDC at all. A >340 Mcsc mode against a sink whose HF-VSDB
does not declare SCDC is refused with
`ScramblingUnsupported`, never silently degraded.

SCDC sequence (`configure_scdc`): refuse unless the
HF-VSDB declares SCDC_Present; read-modify-write
TMDS_CONFIG (0x20) setting SCRAMBLING_ENABLE | ratio 1/40;
wait out the specification's 1 ms minimum settle
(poll-counted, per the #879 poll-budget discipline); read
SCRAMBLER_STATUS (0x21) and require the scrambling bit,
else `ScramblingVerifyFailed`. Configuration runs before
the modeset binds the transcoder.

Clocking: HDMI rates do not come from the fixed DP PLL
rows — `intel_gpu_pll::hdmi_wrpll_coeffs` runs the WRPLL
search (AFE = 5× TMDS clock; DCO window 7 998–10 000 MHz;
the divider list and P/Q/K decomposition transcribed from
`cnl_ddi_calculate_wrpll` / `cnl_wrpll_get_multipliers`;
38.4 MHz reference treated as 19.2 per
`cnl_hdmi_pll_ref_clock`), under the reference family
decoded from the DSSM strap (lane Q6, #1024), as on the DP
path. Rows are fixture-pinned with an
independent decode check (DCO / (P·Q·K) must reproduce
exactly 5× the TMDS clock). `Modeset::modeset_hdmi` omits
the DP-only steps: no M/N, no BUF_TRANS load, no link
training; the DDI buffer enables at the HDMI-fixed 4-lane
width.

Infoframes: AVI (type 0x82, v2, 13 data bytes) and audio
(type 0x84, v1, 10 data bytes) packed per HDMI 1.4 §5.3.5
with the checksum byte making the whole frame sum to
0 mod 256; both pinned byte-for-byte in fixtures. The VIC
comes from the mode's geometry (a small table; exact
timings still govern the modeset — 720×480 pins the 4:3
VIC 2 because the mode shape carries no pixel aspect).
The AVI frame is written through the HSW+ video DIP:
CTL enable bit cleared, the 32-byte DIP image written to
the AVI data bank (the frame's checksum slot is a 1-byte
hardware ECC hole at buffer position 3), enable set,
posting read. The audio infoframe is *not* DIP-programmed
— this hardware has no audio DIP bank; the HDA codec
synthesises it from the published ELD, and the packed
frame rides the connection for that consumer.

Audio consumes the §14 **shared display-audio sink** as
second publisher (`DisplayConnector::Hdmi`; same sink id
per physical connector — DDI index + 1 — because a
connector is either DP or HDMI at a time). The codec side
is the HDMI branch of `intel_gpu_audio`: AUD_CONFIG
carries the PRM pixel-clock code for the TMDS clock and
latches with N_PROG_ENABLE only (no DP timestamp mode, no
N_VALUE_INDEX — the disable path conditions that bit on
the old configuration being DP, so the HDMI disable omits
it too). Publication order matches §14: ELD into the sink
first, codec enable, then ELD_VALID. The cross-vendor
display-audio story is tracked in #778 (AMD), referenced
not closed by this lane.

HPD is the §14 GEN8 DE Port block, shared: HDMI sinks
answer DDC, DP sinks answer AUX, so the glue
(`intel_gpu::handle_dp_hpd_event`) tries the DP connect
first and falls back to HDMI; a fall tears down whichever
session owns the DDI. Short pulses remain DP-only.

Invariants:

- A ≤340 Mcsc connect produces zero SCDC-slave traffic
  (fixture-asserted over the recorded GMBUS programs).
- SCDC writes precede the first TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL write
  (fixture-asserted over the recorded write log).
- The modeset's CFGCR0/CFGCR1 writes for a mode equal the
  WRPLL fixture rows for that TMDS clock.
- Disconnect clears the ELD publication before the
  pipeline comes down, and clears the DDI buffer last.

Fixtures: a GMBUS sink model (EDID store + SCDC register
file decoding the GMBUS1 program fields itself) exercising
1080p connect with no SCDC traffic, 4K60 connect with the
SCDC RMW + verify + func-ctl bit pins, 4K60 refused
without SCDC, scrambling-verify failure, sink NACK,
4-block EDID over the E-DDC segment pointer, HF-VSDB
parsing past a decoy HDMI Licensing VSDB, infoframe
byte pins, and disconnect teardown order.

Deliberate remainders: DVI signalling (same TMDS path,
no infoframes/SCDC — a follow-up, not filed here), YCbCr
4:2:0 and deep colour (character rate ≠ pixel clock —
the rate rule's premise is 8 bpc RGB), HDCP (separate
programme), HDMI 2.1 FRL, Type-C HDMI alt mode.

## 16. Multi-pipe display + DP MST (lane Q11 — `intel_gpu_multipipe`, `intel_gpu_mst`, #1017)

Supersedes §14's "DP MST and multi-pipe" remainder. Compiled
only under the gpu crate's `intel` feature. Sources: VESA
DisplayPort 1.4a (§2.7.6 sideband messaging, §2.11 MST
payload management, PBN accounting), TGL PRM Vol. 11 (DPLL,
power wells), Vol. 12 (DBUF allocation, transcoder/DDI),
Vol. 14 (plane watermarks). The sideband codec and topology
manager are the vendor-neutral `dp_mst` / `dp_mst_mgr`
modules (shared with the AMD MST consumer); this lane adds
the Intel transport adapter, the pipe/DBUF substrate, and
the session composition. No new initcalls: sessions ride
the §14 HPD/initcall flow.

### Multi-pipe substrate (`intel_gpu_multipipe`, `Modeset::for_pipe`)

- **Pipe ownership.** Pipes A–C are allocatable; Pipe D is
  refused (no power well in the Gen12 orchestrator map).
  `PipeAllocator` hands a pipe to exactly one
  `PipeOwner { ddi, used_for }` (`InternalPanel`,
  `ExternalSst`, `ExternalMst`, `AltModeBridge`). Claims are
  idempotent for the same owner, owner-only on release; the
  process-global registry (`PIPE_ALLOCATOR`) is the single
  arbiter between the internal panel, SST sessions, MST
  streams, and Alt-Mode bridge sessions. Probe claims Pipe A
  for the internal panel when takeover produced a mode.
- **Per-pipe modeset.** `Modeset::for_pipe(pipe)` binds the
  pipe, its same-index transcoder, its power well (PG2/PG3/
  PG4 for pipes A/B/C — the i915 ICL+ domain map), and its
  DPLL index (DDI A→DPLL0, B→DPLL1, C→DPLL2; TC DDIs D–H
  share DPLL0 historically — TC PHY PLL programming is a
  named remainder). `Modeset::new` is `for_pipe(Pipe::A)`
  and the single-pipe register sequence is byte-identical
  to the pre-lane orchestrator.
- **Per-pipe GGTT scanout windows.** Windows are strided
  32 MiB apart from `SCANOUT_GTT_OFFSET_PIPE_A`
  (A 0x1000000, B 0x3000000, C 0x5000000) via
  `alloc_contiguous_scanout_at`, so concurrent sessions
  never share a scanout block.
- **DBUF partition.** The partition covers 1024 blocks
  (slice S1; PRM Vol. 12: S1 alone = 1024, S1+S2 = 2048).
  Q6 (#1024) now powers both slices at modeset, but the
  multi-pipe split stays within S1 — using S2 and the PRM
  slice-assignment table are named remainders. With ≥2
  active pipes the coordinator
  (`reprogram_dbuf_shares`) partitions the 1024 blocks into
  contiguous equal shares over the sorted active set and
  reprograms each pipe's PLANE_BUF_CFG / PLANE_WM level 0
  from its share. A lone pipe keeps the preboot programming
  untouched; when the active set drops back to one pipe the
  survivor keeps its last share until its next modeset.
  A pipe with an explicit share is programmed in the
  preboot shape at its share's size; a lone pipe (no share)
  runs Q6 (#1024)'s latency-based watermark algorithm over
  the whole DDB on its own pipe, falling back to the preboot
  values as before.

### MST session (`intel_gpu_mst`)

- **Transport.** `IntelMstAux` implements the manager's
  `MstAux` trait over `IntelAux`, chunking every transfer
  at the 16-byte native AUX limit. `MstLink` owns one DDI's
  `dp_mst_mgr::Manager`, the negotiated caps, the trained
  link, a per-hop available-PBN ledger seeded from
  ENUM_PATH_RESOURCES at probe, and the live stream set.
- **Stream lifecycle.** `add_stream` refuses locally —
  before any modeset or allocation traffic — when the
  stream's PBN exceeds any hop's ledger availability
  (`InsufficientBandwidth { needed_pbn, available_pbn }`).
  The primary stream trains the link via
  `Modeset::modeset_mst_primary` (TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL DP-MST
  mode); secondary streams reuse the trained link via
  `modeset_mst_secondary` and never touch the shared link
  blocks (DPLL, DPCLKA, BUF_TRANS, training, DDI buffer).
  Payload commit order per stream: source payload-table
  entry (`write_payload` part 1), then ALLOCATE_PAYLOAD to
  the end branch (part 2); a partial grant (granted ≠
  requested) is a refusal. Any failure rolls back in
  reverse — payload deallocation and table clear, then
  modeset teardown (full teardown + untrain only when no
  stream survives; otherwise a pipe-scoped
  `teardown_stream`) — so a refused or failed stream never
  disturbs a live one. `remove_stream` deallocates,
  clears the table entry, tears down, credits the ledger,
  and compacts surviving streams' table slots back to
  dense (slot 0 is the MTP header; VCPIs are 1..=63).
- **Notifications.** Up requests drained on the HPD
  RetrainRequired path surface as `MstEvent`s;
  RESOURCE_STATUS_NOTIFY additionally updates the ledger
  entry for the notifying branch's port.
- **Failure discipline.** Sideband timeouts, NAKs, and
  malformed replies are the manager's typed errors,
  wrapped unchanged (`MstError::Mgr`); AUX failures stay
  `MstError::Aux`. A DDI whose sink lacks MST capability
  (DPCD rev < 1.2 or MSTM_CAP clear) falls back to the §14
  SST session. An HPD disconnect tears streams down in
  reverse order, disconnects the manager, and releases
  the pipes.

Named remainders: per-stream MST display audio, DSC/FEC
over MST, TC PHY PLL programming for DDI D–H, DBUF slice
S2, fb-console publication staying single-slot (last HPD
wins; per-pipe publication is a console-layer decision),
and the Alt-Mode bridge holding its pipe claim for the
session lifetime (the bridge trait has no exit hook).
## 17. Xe-LPG display — Meteor Lake (lane Q10, #1016)

Meteor Lake's display engine is Xe-LPG, a different IP block
from Gen12's Xe-LP. Before this lane, probe identified MTL SKUs
but the takeover path ran the Gen12 sequence at them; lane 1
gated MTL/PTL to identify-and-skip, and this lane implements
the real Xe-LPG path. Sources are the Meteor Lake display PRM
(§2) as implemented by i915 — `intel_cx0_phy_regs.h`,
`intel_cx0_phy.c`, `intel_cdclk.c`, `intel_ddi.c`,
`intel_display_power_map.c` — never the Gen12 code being
diverged from.

Structure: dispatch is by generation at the single takeover
entry (`intel_gpu_modeset::takeover_display`). Gen12 silicon
runs the Gen12 orchestrator byte-identically; Meteor Lake runs
`intel_gpu_modeset_xelpg::XeLpgModeset`. The pipe / transcoder /
plane register block did not move, so both orchestrators build
those programs from the shared `intel_gpu_pipes` codecs.

### 10.1 Port / PHY map

| Port | BAR0 block | PHY | TRANS_CLK_SEL idx | TRANS_DDI_FUNC_CTL idx | AUX well (AUX2) |
| ---- | ---------- | --- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| DDI A | 0x64000 | C10 | 0 | 0 | AUX_A (0) |
| DDI B | 0x64100 | C10 | 1 | 1 | AUX_B (1) |
| TC1 | 0x16F200 | C20 | 2 | 9 | AUX_USBC1 (3) |
| TC2 | 0x16F400 | C20 | 3 | 10 | AUX_USBC2 (4) |

Port register offsets are per-port absolutes, not a uniform
stride (e.g. the message-bus timer sits at +0xD8 on DDI A/B but
+0x58 on the TC ports). `DDI_CLK_VALFREQ` exists only on the
C10 ports; C20 carries its rate in the PHY's serdes-rate VDR.

### 10.2 PHY programming (C10 / C20)

The port PLLs live inside the PHYs and are programmed over a
per-lane message bus (`M2P_MSGBUS_CTL` / `P2M_MSGBUS_STATUS`):
write transactions are committed or uncommitted, every
transaction is followed by a bus reset, and an ACK whose
command type doesn't match the transaction — or any answer
with the error bit set — fails the modeset with
`ModesetError::PhyBusFailure` rather than programming through
a wrong-generation PHY. C10 state is a 20-byte PLL table plus
CMN/TX bytes; C20 state lives in SRAM contexts (the program
writes the context the serdes toggle bit does not select,
then flips the bit). TX signal levels are VDR override
registers (SNPS preset tables), staged before training and
re-applied with the trained levels after. PLL enable order:
port clock control (MAXPCLK select, SSC PLLB for the MPLLB
tables) → lane reset + powerdown staging (P2 reset, then P0
active) → PLL state → per-TX single-TX disables →
`DDI_CLK_VALFREQ` (C10 only) → PCLK PLL request/ACK. Every MTL
port also traverses the die-to-die (D2D) link, enabled
unconditionally in the retrain preamble.

### 10.3 Power wells and CDCLK

Xe-LPD well topology (`PWR_WELL_CTL2` = 0x45404,
`PWR_WELL_CTL_AUX2` = 0x45444, HSW request/state encoding):
PW_1 (idx 0, transcoder A + DDI A/B) → PW_A (idx 5, pipe A) →
the port's AUX well. CDCLK runs on the fixed 38.4 MHz MTL
reference: six rungs (172.8–652.8 MHz), the two lowest reached
by squash waveforms programmed in `CDCLK_SQUASH_CTL`; the
modeset raises CDCLK to the `pixel_clock ≤ 2 × CDCLK` floor
and never lowers a faster firmware setting. The current-CDCLK
readback decodes ratio + divider + squash popcount — under
squash the CDCLK_CTL decimal field is nominal and is not
trusted.

### 10.4 Gates and named remainders

- `display_supported()`: Gen12 + Meteor Lake. **Panther Lake
  stays off** — Xe3-LPD is a different display IP generation
  (widened clock-select fields, different PLL tables and DDI
  arrangement); the MTL sequence must not claim it.
- `backlight_supported()`: Gen12 only. MTL's PWM path belongs
  to the backlight composition lane (PR #1037); the modeset
  shipping first must not claim a backlight it cannot drive.
- Region enumeration: `RegionGeneration::XeLpg` — display at
  0x40000/0x40000 plus the TC block at 0x16F000/0x1000, and
  **no DPLL region** (Xe-LPG has no DPLL block; Gen12's DPLL
  range is the TC block here).
- Not programmed by this lane: watermark / DBUF allocation
  (i915 computes MTL allocations from pcode latency tables;
  firmware's allocation is retained), HDMI PLL states, DP 2.0
  UHBR rates (the DP stack tops out at HBR3), MST / multi-pipe,
  DVFS/pcode notifications around CDCLK changes, and
  per-iteration TX-level updates inside the DPCD training loop
  (would need a source-side callback in the shared
  `dp_link_training`; levels are staged before training and
  re-applied after, the same simplification class as Gen12's
  preloaded DDI_BUF_TRANS table).
- §5's device table is unchanged by this lane: the MTL DIDs
  were already in the census; only their display gate moved.
## 14. Media engines — VCS / VECS (`intel_gpu_media`, #1022)

The Gen12 media engines brought to the §8 (RCS0) standard.
The execlists machinery of §8 is shared, not forked:
`intel_gpu_rcs` is generalised over an `EngineSpec` (register
base, descriptor engine class + instance, context-image
allocation bound, render-group presence), and each media
engine is an `RcsEngine` instantiated over its spec. Compiled
only under the gpu crate's `intel` feature; no new initcalls
(the engines attach lazily like RCS). Sources: TGL PRM
Vol. 2c (engine register blocks), cross-checked against
i915's `intel_gt_regs.h` (Gen11 media ring bases),
`intel_engine_cs.c` (engine table, per-class context sizes),
`intel_lrc.c` (descriptor upper-dword construction; the
Gen12 XCS register-state offset table), and `i915_reg.h`
(Gen11 media forcewake sub-domain registers).

Public interface:

- Engine table — `VCS0_SPEC` (base `0x1c0000`, video-decode
  class 1, instance 0), `VCS1_SPEC` (base `0x1c4000`, class
  1, instance 1), `VECS0_SPEC` (base `0x1c8000`,
  video-enhance class 2, instance 0);
  `GEN12_MEDIA_ENGINES` and `media_engines_for(gen)` are the
  inventory. The probe path announces exactly this set for a
  probed Gen12 part; no engine-query UAPI exists in the tree
  yet, and none is claimed here.
- Descriptor — `context_descriptor_for(spec, lrca, sw_id)`
  in `intel_gpu_rcs`: SW id at bits 37:47, engine instance
  at bits 48:53, engine class at bits 61:63 with the
  Gen12-era i915 class numbering (render 0, video decode 1,
  video enhance 2, copy 3, other 4). The RCS descriptor is
  the class-0/instance-0 special case and is byte-identical
  to its pre-generalisation form.
- Register state — `build_reg_state_for(spec, …)`: the
  shared PRM ENGINE CONTEXT layout at the engine's own base.
  The one structural delta from RCS: group 2
  (`R_PWR_CLK_STATE`) is render-only (i915's Gen12 XCS
  offset table has no third group), so media templates
  leave those dwords zero. Media image allocation bound is
  4 pages over the 2-page non-render hardware image
  (`GEN8_LR_CONTEXT_OTHER_SIZE`).
- VA batches — `RcsEngine::submit_ppgtt` (§8's engine, any
  spec): the batch-start carries the PPGTT address-space
  indicator, the batch is addressed at the VA equal to its
  GGTT offset (identity placement over the GGTT arena), and
  submission refuses with `PpgttNotAttached` when the
  context carries no root from §9's `attach_ppgtt`. This is
  the VA-batch step §8/§9 deferred to this lane.
- Forcewake — `MediaForcewake`: refcounted holds over the
  Gen11 media sub-domains (`VdBox(n)` request `0xa540 + 4n`,
  ack `0x0d50 + 4n`; `VeBox(n)` request `0xa560 + 4n`, ack
  `0x0d70 + 4n`), masked-write protocol with the
  aggregate-domain discipline (poll-counted ack budget,
  one clear→set re-kick, rollback on timeout). Production
  submissions and engine bring-up run inside the engine's
  sub-domain hold; completion polling takes none (the CSB
  is host memory). Composition with the aggregate MEDIA
  domain of #1013 is at the marked seam in
  `submit_media_dwords` — the sub-domain hold nests inside
  it once that lane lands.
- Production glue — `submit_media_dwords(engine, dwords)` /
  `poll_media_completions(engine)` over `MediaEngineId`,
  mirroring §8's glue. Every production engine on the
  controller allocates from the one arena
  (`intel_gpu_rcs::production_arena`), so objects never
  alias across engines.

Invariants:

- One engine's contexts, rings, status page and doorbell
  never alias another's: the fixtures run all three engines
  concurrently over one arena and one register file and
  assert per-engine descriptors, completions and
  breadcrumbs; a wedged engine (hardware never posts CSB)
  does not block a peer's submissions or completions.
- A failed forcewake acquire holds nothing; a media
  submission's doorbell is always inside a held sub-domain
  (fixture-pinned write order).
- The generalised §8 paths are regression-pinned: the RCS
  descriptor and RCS register-state template are asserted
  byte-identical to their pre-generalisation forms, and the
  existing §8 fixtures pass unchanged.

Flagged for first-silicon verification: the per-SKU media
engine set (a part with an engine fused off is still listed
— the media fuse readout that trims the table is not
modelled); the 4-page media image bound; and the descriptor
class numbering's era (later i915 trees renumbered their
internal class enum — the Gen12 execlists construction
governs here). BCS0 (copy, base `0x22000`) is one more
`EngineSpec` away and deliberately out of this lane's
scope; MTL media belongs to the Xe-LPG GT generation and is
not claimed.
